<h1 class="headline">1997 - Bubonic Plague in Zambia</h1>
<p>
<span><b>31 January 1997</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Between 13 December 1997 and 27 January 1997, 90 cases of plague with 22 deaths
were reported in Namwala District in the Southern Province.  Fifteen cases have been isolated.
The diagnosis is at present based on clinical presentation and laboratory diagnosis is expected
imminently when a medical team returns from the area.  The outbreak could be linked heavy rain
and flooding causing rats to invade inhabited areas.  Fleas are also abundant.  The first human
cases presented with inguinal, axillary and cervical abscesses in December and deaths began to
occur in early January.  Control measures now include control of fleas and rodents and treating
and isolating patients. </span></p>
<p>
<span>Comment:  Plague is endemic in many countries in southern Africa where natural foci still exist,
such as in neighbouring Angola, Malawi,Mozambique, Tanzania and Zimbabwe but also in
Madagascar, Namibia and South Africa.    The cases reported in Zambia are bubonic plague
which is not an airborne infection as the pulmonary form of plague.  There are no restrictions for
travellers visiting Zambia or in transit in airports in the country.</span></p>
