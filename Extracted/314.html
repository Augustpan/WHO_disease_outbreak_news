<p>
<span><b>14 July 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Following reports of an outbreak of diarrhoeal disease, a rapid-response team has
visited the district of Dabola located 450km from Conakry. Out of 7 patients found and
examined, 5 were suffering from bloody diarrhoea. Of 7 samples sent to the laboratory at
Donka hospital, 1 was identified as <em>Shigella dysenteriae</em> type 1 resistant to
ampicillin, chloramphenicol and erythromycin; it was however sensitive to nalidixic acid.
All 7 patients have been treated with norfloxacin and have recovered. No new case has been
reported.</span></p>
<p>
<span>On 2 July, 2 stool samples were sent to the Institut Pasteur in Dakar (Senegal) for
additional testing and to obtain confirmation of the diagnosis. Other samples will be sent
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States. Surveillance
measures in the area have been strengthened, and the Ministry of Health has requested
additional stocks of nalidixic acid.</span></p>
