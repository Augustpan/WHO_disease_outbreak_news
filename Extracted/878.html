<b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 23 February 2003, the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso has reported 3 107 cases, including 480 deaths in the country (<a id="2962">see previous report</a>). Of the 53 districts in Burkina Faso, 7 districts have reached the epidemic threshold: Batie, Bogande, Bousse, Manga, Pama, Po and Zabre and 9 districts are in the alert phase: Barsalogho, Boulsa, Dano, Koudougou, Leo, Nanoro, Sapone, Tenkodogo and Zorgho,  The  incidence overall is still increasing. Preliminary results from samples tested indicate <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> serogroups A and W135. <br/><br/>
 
The Ministry of Health, which has established a Crisis Committee, is implementing measures to control the outbreak: reinforcement of the epidemiological and laboratory surveillance, case management with oily chloramphenicol and a mass vaccination campaign. <br/><br/>

The vaccination campaign is ongoing in Batie, Manga and Bogande.  WHO, with its partners in the <a id="1766">International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control (ICG),</a> is providing Burkina Faso with the ACW135 trivalent vaccine. As the global stock of trivalent vaccine is currently limited to 2 million doses, if the campaign is extended throughout the country, funds will be needed to produce additional vaccine.
