<h1 class="headline">1998 - Hurricane Mitch and epidemic risk</h1>
<p>
<span><b>06 November 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Hurricane Mitch and associated flooding have affected 3-5 million persons in Central
America, and caused an unknown number of deaths. Although epidemics are relatively rare in
  the aftermath of natural disasters, in this case there is a combination of high-risk
  factors which could lead to an increase in the transmission of communicable diseases: the
  magnitude of the hurricane, the large number of displaced persons, the contamination of
  drinking-water and poor sanitation conditions.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Even though the mosquito population may decrease (washing effect of the storm) in the
first weeks following the hurricane, it will inevitably rebound due to the subsequent
  accumulation of stagnant water. This could lead to an increased risk of malaria and dengue
  epidemics in an area that is already highly endemic for these diseases.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Cholera is also endemic in Central America, and again the risk of transmission is
likely to increase. Information regarding suspected cases of cholera in the suburbs of
  Managua (Nicaragua) has recently been received from field workers.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Although no epidemic has been confirmed so far, WHO strongly recommends that relief
agencies pay particular attention to epidemic readiness and water safety activities.</span></p>
