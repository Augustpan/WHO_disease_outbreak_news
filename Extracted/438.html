<h1 class="headline">2000 - Cholera in the Federated States of Micronesia- Update</h1>
<p>
<span><b>08 September 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 21 August, the public health authorities of Pohnpei
State reported a total of 2 689 cases and 15 deaths from the cholera outbreak they first
reported on 17 April. <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> biotype El Tor serotype Ogawa has been
identified <a href="/csr/don/2000_07_06/en">(see previous report)</a>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The public health authorities of the Federated States of
Micronesia with the support of WHO and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC),
have decided to implement a cholera vaccination campaign in the unaffected islands, using
the live oral CVD-103HgR vaccine.  Several clinical studies have shown that one oral
dose of this vaccine provides 70-90% protective immunity after only seven days.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Although the outbreak is still ongoing, it is limited to
Pohnpei island.  However, the cholera vaccination campaign is a preventive measure to
contain the spread of cholera to other areas.</span></p>
<p>
<span>This cholera vaccine campaign does not replace the usual
recommendations for safe water, appropriate sanitation and environmental measures, but is
rather a complementary tool to contain the cholera outbreak in this specific situation.</span></p>
