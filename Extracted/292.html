<p>
<span>Following a trade fair in Kapellen, Belgium, an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease has
been reported. So far, out of 80 persons who developed clinical symptoms, 13 had positive
  urinary tests including 4 who died.</span></p>

<span>Over 60.000 visitors attended the fair, and initial investigation suggests that
