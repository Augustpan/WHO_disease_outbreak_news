<p>
<span><b>23 October 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As ofÂ  23 October, the Ugandan Ministry of
Health has reported 160 cases, including 55 deaths.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Reporting and distribution of cases <br/>
The increase in cases reflects transmission of the disease as it occurred about 8-10 days
earlier. As the incubation period is 2 to 21 days, monitoring of the disease for new cases
is more accurate when carried out over time rather than day by day. Since Ebola
haemorrhagic fever outbreaks usually originate from a single source, cases tend to come in
waves: exposure through direct contact, incubation period and then illness.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Case finding is continuing in Gulu district. The
operational task force is also intensifying its efforts to trace contacts and monitor<br/>
these people.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Adequate supplies in Gulu district<br/>
The additional 1 370 kg of protective equipment sent by WHO arrived in Gulu district on 23
October. This equipment is adequate to meet the needs of the initial phase of the
response.</span></p>
