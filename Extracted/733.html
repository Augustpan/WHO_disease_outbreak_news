<h1 class="headline">Poliomyelitis in West Africa: Togo, Burkina Faso and Ghana </h1>
<p>
<span><b>9 October 2003</b><br/><br/> <b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>A case of poliomyelitis due to wild poliovirus was confirmed in Togo, with date of onset 22 July 2003.</span></p>
<p>
<span>This case, as well as cases reported in 2003 from Burkina Faso and Ghana, were found to be due to wild poliovirus type 1 that is genetically related to a lineage of wild poliovirus circulating in northern Nigeria and southern Niger.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To date in 2003, 1 case of poliomyelitis following importation of wild poliovirus has been reported in Togo, 1 case in Burkina Faso, and 6 cases in Ghana.</span></p>
<p>
<span>For Burkina Faso, Ghana and Togo, the appearance of cases in 2003 follow long periods without isolation of wild poliovirus, in the presence of high-quality surveillance. Burkina Faso has been polio-free since 2001 with the exception of one case following importation of wild poliovirus in 2002. Ghana has been polio-free since 2001. Togo has been polio-free since 2000.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Given the close proximity to Nigeria, one of the three main poliovirus reservoirs in the world, the ongoing risk of importations remains high.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Ministries of Health in Burkina Faso, Ghana and Togo as well as those in Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon will conduct synchronized National Immunization Days (NIDs) targeting children aged &lt; 5="" yrs,="" starting="" 22="" october.="" it="" is="" critical="" that="" every="" child="" is="" reached="" during="" these="" activities="" to="" ensure="" that="" population="" immunity="" is="" high="" enough="" to="" stop="" any="" transmission="" of="" wild="" poliovirus="" and="" to="" protect="" against="" further=""&gt;</span></p>
