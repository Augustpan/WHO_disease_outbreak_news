<h1 class="headline">1998 - Cholera - Vibrio cholerae O139 strain</h1>
<p>
<span><b>22 September 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO stresses importance of careful monitoring of <i>Vibrio
cholerae </i>O139 strain</span></p>
<p>
<span>In 1992, the world was alarmed by a severe outbreak of cholera in the Bay of Bengal
caused by a non-O1 strain of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, serogroup O139. The fast spread of
  this new strain to neighbouring countries and the notification of imported cases in
  developed countries, raised concern as to the possible occurrence of a new pandemic of
  cholera.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Vibrio cholerae O139 has been detected since then in 10 countries. This new
strain continues to be confined to South-East Asia. In 1998, <i>V. cholerae </i>O139 has
  been isolated from 3 patients in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and 3 in India.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Although no major outbreaks have been caused by <i>V. cholerae </i>O139 since 1994, the
fear that this new strain could become a global threat is still present, particularly in
  Asia, where extremely heavy rainfalls and floods have contributed to an increase in cases
  and deaths due to cholera.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The WHO Global Cholera Task Force recommends that efforts to monitor the spread of <i>V.
cholerae </i>O139 at a global level must be continued and/or strengthened.</span></p>
