<h1 class="headline">2001 - Cholera in South Africa - Update 13</h1>
<p>
<span><b>26 January 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 25 January, the Kwazulu-Natal
Department of Health has reported 27 431 cases and 74 deaths since the start of the
outbreak in mid-August 2000.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The outbreak in Kwazulu-Natal is primarily affecting the
Empangeni area, made up of the Lower Umfolozi districts and the Eshowe/Nkandla area. The
lower South Coast is affected mainly in the KwaDukuza/Stanger area and Ugu Region/South
Coast.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Cholera is endemic to the eastern seaboard of southern
Africa and outbreaks can occur sporadically in any part of the world where water supplies,
sanitation, food safety and hygiene practices are inadequate.</span></p>
<p>
<span>An overall management strategy is being implemented to
include treatment of patients, provision of clean water and sanitation as well as
education and information about how to live in a cholera area.  The Department of
Health will also work with the Department of Education to bring this information into
schools. </span></p>
<p>
<span>No special restrictions on travel to and from KwaZulu-Natal
are warranted.</span></p>
