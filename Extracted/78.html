of the last case on 12 March 1996.  The outbreak was therefore officially declared over on 23
April 1996, after a lapse of 42 days corresponding to twice the maximum incubation period.  The
outbreak occurred in the village of Mayibout II, Makokou Health District, Ogooue-Ivindo
Province.  It was linked to the butchering, transport and preparation for consumption of a
chimpanzee found dead in the forest on 24 January 1996.  The total number of cases was 37 (20
males, 17 females) and the mean age was 27 years (range 7 months to 70 years)</span></p>
