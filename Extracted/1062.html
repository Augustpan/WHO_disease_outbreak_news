<span><b>06 September 2005</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 31 August, two new polio cases were reported in Ethiopia, bringing the total number of cases associated with this outbreak to 15 in 2005.  One of the two new cases occurred in Oromia Province, in the centre of the country, near the border with Somalia and had onset of paralysis on 1 July 2005.  The second case, in Amhara region, the north-western part of Ethiopia, had onset of paralysis on 16 July.  Both cases occurred after the National Immunization Days (NIDs) held on 23 May.  
<br/><br/>
Discussions are ongoing to advance the next NIDs to early October.  Ethiopia had been polio-free since January 2001, before a poliovirus was imported into the country from neighbouring Sudan in December 2004.</span></p>
