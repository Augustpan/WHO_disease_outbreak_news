has been reported in Durba, Watsa Zone, in the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC). Clinical features include fever, headache, lassitude, gastrointestinal bleeding,
coughing up blood and agitiation. The first cases are believed to have occurred in January
1999. Between January and 28 April, 50 cases, with 46 deaths have been recorded (CFR=92%).
The earliest cases appear to have occurred in gold miners, but now cases are occurring
among those living in the community. The WHO Office in DRC and the WHO Regional Office for
Africa in Harare, Zimbabwe and MSF(Belgium and Holland) are preparing a team to
investigate. The security situation in the area is poor and access to the affected area
may be extremely difficult.</span></p>
