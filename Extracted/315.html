<h1 class="headline">1999 - Malaria in Burundi</h1>
<p>
<span><b>25 June 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Between January and May 1999, a total of 616 034 cases of malaria was reported by
health centres. In January, all provinces were affected, and although only 75% of
provinces were affected in May, there was a significant increase in some (especially
Karusi, with 2.5 times more cases in May than in April).</span></p>
<p>
<span>A comparison of data for May 1998 and May 1999 has shown that in some provinces, cases
have increased very sharply (e.g. Mutoyi, from 3 094 to 7 568; Rutoke, from 293 to
1 768). Figures concerning the number of deaths are not available for all provinces.
In Mutoyi, a total of 17 deaths was registered between January and May; in Karusi, 34
deaths were recorded between 15 May and 15 June.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The local health authorities have taken the necessary measures to mobilize resources
for drug procurement, reinforced epidemiological surveillance and vector control.</span></p>
