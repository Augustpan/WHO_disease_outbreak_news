<span>In the week of 26 January - 2 February 2003,  the Ministry of Health has reported  369 cases and 58 deaths in the country (<a id="2931">see previous report</a>).  Of the 53 districts in Burkina Faso, 4 districts have reached the epidemic threshold: Batie, Leo, Sapone and Manga (in alert phase but neighbouring a district in the epidemic phase); and 7 districts are in the alert phase: Dande, Nanoro, Reo, Titao, Zabre and  Zorgho. <br/>

The Crisis Committee established by the Ministry of Health is implementing measures to contain the outbreak.  WHO, with its partners in the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control (ICG) is working to provide Burkina Faso with the trivalent vaccine recently made available.  This vaccine which covers <i>Neisseria meningitidis </i>serogroups A, C and W135 will be used to respond to the needs of countries in the African meningitis belt.
