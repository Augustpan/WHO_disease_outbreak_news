<h1 class="headline">1998 - Hurricane Mitch, update</h1>
<p>
<span><b>10 November 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Hurricane Mitch approached the coast of Honduras on 27 October as a Category V
hurricane. At that point, and subsequently for a number of days, it stalled off the coast,
  producing very heavy rainfall. The rains in many countries in Central America, caused
  rivers to overflow and provoked serious mudslides in many areas.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To date, it has been very difficult to finalize an evaluation of health sector needs
because of conditions in the country. There are no communications within the country.
  Tegucigalpa is inaccessible from the north, south and west of the country, making it very
  difficult for fuel and food to arrive. The roads to the north and to the south are
  seriously damaged. At this writing, more than 5,000 people have lost their lives,
  approximately 1.5 million persons have been affected, 500,000 have been evacuated, an
  estimated 70,000 homes have been damaged. (These figures are conservative.)</span></p>
<p>
<span>The 50-bed San Lorenzo Hospital was destroyed. The Social Security Hospital is not
serviceable. The roof of the Roatan Hospital was totally destroyed. Other units of the
  health services network suffered considerable damages, and are without electrical energy
  and water supply. A large percentage of health workers are themselves among the affected
  and/or evacuated.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Some of the most pressing needs are for medicines and other critical supplies; vector
control; adequate collection and treatment of solid waste; rehabilitation of primary
  health services; health education and communication; equipment for the San Lorenzo
  Hospital; and assessment of the damages and project design for the rehabilitation phase.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The water distribution system is damaged, and the network needs urgent repair. The
majority of surface water outlets have disappeared. In coming weeks, Tegucigalpa will
  suffer water rationing, and even the areas that can be repaired most quickly will only
  have water once or twice a week.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Nicaragua's National Civil Defense System has provided the following figures (as of 4
November) on the number of people affected by Hurricane Mitch:</span></p>

<p>
<span>The Pacific and northern regions of the country were most affected. In addition to the
actual and potential loss of life, the principal damages can be summarized as follows: <ul>
<li>In addition to the widespread threat of vector borne diseases, there is a severe threat
      of diarrhea, respiratory and dermatological diseases. </li>
<li>Much of the country's infrastructure was partially or totally destroyed, including 2500
      km. of roads and more than 80 bridges. </li>
<li>Environmental deterioration, contamination and destruction of basic services such as
      water supply systems, wells, latrines, as well as an increase in the number of areas which
      have become a breeding ground for vectors. </li>
<li>Generalized overcrowding in shelters designed to accommodate fewer people, with a lack
      of proper waste management services. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<span>There has been a great deal of damage to infrastructure in this country. The death toll
is 239 and 60,000 people have been displaced and are being housed in 107 shelters
  throughout the country.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In spite of efforts by national authorities to adequately house all of the population
who need shelter, health and sanitation conditions may deteriorate in the current
  conditions persist for a lengthy period of time. Source: Regional Office for the
