<p>
<span><b>19 December 2006 </b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 15 December 2006, the Ministry of Health, Togo reported 3 cases of yellow fever in 2 adjacent districts, Dankpen district, Kara region and Oti district, Savanes region in the northern part of the country. Yellow fever has been laboratory confirmed in the three cases (males aged 9, 15 and 20) by Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A team from the Ministry of Health and the WHO country office are currently carrying out a field investigation. Since the most recent mass vaccination campaign in this area was conducted in 1987, there are concerns for a highly susceptible population. The Ministry of Health will be requesting additional vaccine from the <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/disease/yellowfev/global_partnership/en/">International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Yellow fever Control</a> to carry out a mass vaccination campaign, with the support of WHO and UNICEF. A stockpile of 6 million doses of yellow fever vaccine is provided annually by the <a href="http://www.gavialliance.org">GAVI Alliance</a> to rapidly respond to outbreaks.</span></p>
