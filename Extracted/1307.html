<span>From 1-31 January 2006, 136 suspected cases and 15 deaths of meningococcal disease have been reported in six states of Sudan.  The epidemic threshold has been crossed in two administrative units (Guli in Blue Nile State and Wad el Heleu in Kassala State).  One specimen of cerebral spinal fluid has been found positive for <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> serogroup A by latex test.  Results from additional specimens sent to the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum are expected shortly. </span></p>

<span>The Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) had established a National Task force including UNICEF, WHO and nongovernmental organizations. WHO is supporting the FMOH in their field investigations, the provision of outbreak control supplies, strengthening surveillance as well as in the assessment of vaccination needs.</span></p>
