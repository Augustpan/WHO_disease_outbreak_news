<p>
<span><b>26 February 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The World Health Organization has been
informed by several Ministries of Health in countries of eastern and southern Africa of an
  increase in cholera cases and deaths. The situation in eastern Africa is similar to that
  at the end of 1997 when almost all countries in the Horn of Africa were affected by severe
  cholera outbreaks or threathened by them. Most of the countries then affected continued to
  report cases of cholera to WHO throughout 1998. However, sudden increases in cases and
  deaths are now being reported in the same countries as well as countries in southern
  Africa .</span></p>
<p>
<span>Countries recently reporting new or increased cholera activity are: Kenya, Mozambique,
Somalia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</span></p>
