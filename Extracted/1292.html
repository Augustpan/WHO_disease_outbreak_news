<p>
<span>From 28 January to 21 February 2006, a total number of 3793 cases and 77 deaths from acute watery diarrhoea, with an overall case fatality rate of 2.03% was reported from two major towns in southern Sudan, Yei and Juba. <i>Vibrio cholera</i> Inaba has been laboratory confirmed in several stool samples by African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) laboratories in Nairobi. While transmission seems to be declining in Yei town, the outbreak in Juba town is expected to increase in the coming days.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A task force under the Ministry of Health of the Government of Southern Sudan (MOH/GoSS), including the Federal Ministry of Health and WHO, has been established to coordinate the overall public health response. Several control measures are being implemented to contain the outbreak. These include strengthening the surveillance and reporting system, standardizing case management and promoting health education and hygiene, with the chlorination of public water supplies.</span></p>
