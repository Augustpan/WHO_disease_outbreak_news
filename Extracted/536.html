<p>
<span>As of 12 September, the Ministry of Health has reported 143
suspected cases in the entire country, with 27 suspected cases in Abidjan.</span></p>

<span>The Ministry of Health is currently carrying out
vaccination campaigns using existing national vaccine stocks in the areas of Abidjan where
cases have been identified.  WHO is working closely with UNICEF and Aventis<strong> </strong>to
dispatch the crucially needed vaccine to supply the mass vaccination campaign in
Abidjan.  The campaign will cover the city's 3.5 million population and will
begin on 17 September.  Two hundred vaccination teams have already been trained and
all vaccine sites identified. The international team will be assisting the Ministry of
Health to implement this campaign. (<a href="/csr/don/2001_09_12/en">see previous report</a>)</span></p>
