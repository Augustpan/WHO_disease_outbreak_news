<span><b>05 February 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 4 February, the Kwazulu-Natal
Department of Health has reported 37 204 cases and 85 deaths since the start of the
outbreak in mid-August 2000.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The outbreak in Kwazulu-Natal is primarily affecting the
Empangeni area, made up of the Lower Umfolozi districts and the Eshowe/Nkandla area. The
lower South Coast is affected mainly in the KwaDukuza/Stanger area and Ugu Region/South
Coast.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Department of Health has noted that although the
infection rates are high, the case-fatality rate of less than 0.4% is exceptionally low.
 </span></p>
<p>
<span>To combat the disease in the current outbreak, the
Department is providing clinical care as well as working with the other sectors to provide
clean water and education and information about how to live in a cholera area.  A
longer term programme to provide adequate water and sanitation will be implemented over
the next 3 years. </span></p>
<p>
<span>No special restrictions on travel to and from KwaZulu-Natal
are warranted.</span></p>
