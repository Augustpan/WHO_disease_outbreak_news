<h1 class="headline">1998 - Cholera in Peru</h1>
<p>
<span><b>25 February 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>A large increase in cholera cases has been reported in Peru since the end of 1997. In
the first four weeks of 1998 a total of 2 863 cases with 16 deaths had been reported
  compared with only 174 cases with 1 death in the corresponding period of 1997.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The largest numbers of cases were reported in the following departments:- Arequipa,
Lima, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Ancash and Cuzco but cases have occurred in many other
  departments including those in the forest areas where no cases or very few had previously
  been reported.</span></p>
<p>
<span>This large increase has probably occurred as a result of storms and floods caused by El
NiÂ–o. The national authorities are discussing with WHO the necessity of stepping up
  and reactivating cholera control activities and neighbouring countries have been informed
  of the situation.</span></p>
