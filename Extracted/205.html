<h1 class="headline">1998 - Rift Valley fever in Mauritania</h1>
<p>
<span><b>10 November 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>An outbreak of Rift Valley fever has occurred in the Aioun area, in south-eastern
Mauritania. There have been 300-400 human cases (febrile disease), including 6 deaths
  between 15 and 30 September (some with haemorrhage and icterus). The latter were aged
  between 14 and 40 years, and all were from areas where goats, sheep, cattle and camels are
  raised. In the Assaba area, 2 patients were admitted to hospital; both died. The epidemic
  peaked in late September/early October, and the most recent case was reported around 25
  October. Rift Valley fever virus has been isolated from 2 samples (1 postmortem) at the
  Pasteur Institute in Dakar (Senegal). Livestock were also severely affected (with up to
  100% abortion rates for some species), which will have serious economic consequences for
  the population. The Ministry of Health has issued recommendations, and is carrying out
  investigations with the support of WHO and FAO.<!-- If this story is part of a continuing thread, then enter the title of the previous or next article in the quotes below.  --></span></p>
