<h1 class="headline">2000 - Rift Valley fever in Yemen - Update 4</h1>
<p>
<span><b>26 October 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 19 October, the Ministry of Public Health in Yemen
has reported 653 suspected cases, including 80 deaths.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Laboratory testing has confirmed the disease in humans and
animals in 4 governorates: Hodeidah, Hajjah, Mahweet and Sadeh and there is serologic evidence of the disease in animals in Dhamar
governorate.   Surveillance and control activities are ongoing.  Although the
disease is restricted to the north-western part of the country, areas to the southwest are
now experiencing evidence of Rift Valley fever transmission.</span></p>
<p>
<span>There is persistent transmission in El-Zuhrah district,
Hodeidah governorate despite extensive and vigorous mosquito control activities. A team of
epidemiologists will be carrying out a survey in El-Zuhrah district to assess the
importance of direct animal contact versus exposure to mosquitoes as a risk factor for
disease.  It will also assess the economic impact of the outbreak on the community.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A joint technical team has been formed by the Ministries of
Health and Agriculture of the governments of Yemen and Saudi Arabia to fight the epidemic.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO has launched an appeal for US$ 975 000 to support
efforts to control and prevent Rift Valley Fever  in Yemen (<a href="/csr/don/2000_10_09/en">see previous report</a>).</span></p>
