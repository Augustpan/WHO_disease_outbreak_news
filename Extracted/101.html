<p>
<span><b>29 February 1996</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 27 February, 24 cases of which 17 were fatal had been reported.  Control measures
instituted in Gabon by the Ministry of Health and an international medical team appear to be
containing the further spread.  However, sporadic secondary cases can still be expected.
Teams sent to investigate rumours of cases in Djoum on the border between Gabon and
Cameroon did not find any case of suspect Ebola haemorrhagic fever.  Another team was sent
from Brazzaville on 26 February to villages in northern part of Congo for a similar inquiry.</span></p>
