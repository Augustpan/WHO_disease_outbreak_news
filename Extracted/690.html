<h1 class="headline">2002 - Meningococcal meningitis in Ethiopia - Update</h1>
<p>
<span><b>21 February 2002</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 3 February, the Ethiopian Ministry of Health has
reported a total of 1 332 cases of meningococcal disease including 85 deaths* mainly in
Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) since the onset of the
outbreak in September 2001.  <i>Neisseria meningitidis </i>serogroup A has been
laboratory confirmed. A vaccination campaign had been undertaken in three
woredas (districts) in Sidama Zone, but there have been localized epidemics and an increase in the number
of cases reported from other districts and zones in the Region.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In response, the Federal Ministry of Health has
re-activated the Task Force on Epidemic Meningococcal Disease for the current epidemic
season.  The Task Force consists of WHO, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF- France,
Holland, Switzerland and Belgium), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies, Ethiopian Red Cross, United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), UNICEF and European Union Humanitarian Office (ECHO); it is working
to coordinate control activities including surveillance, case management, vaccination
campaigns and logistics.</span></p>
<p>
<span>SNNPR is one of the biggest regions in Ethiopia, with an
estimated population of over 12.5 million people. The high population density, current dry
season and low immunization coverage exacerbate the potential for a major meningitis
epidemic.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To prevent this from becoming a reality, the Ministry of
Health on behalf of the Task Force is urgently appealing for funds to carry out a mass
immunization campaign in 5 priority zones in SNNPR: Hadia, Sidama, Gedeo, North Omo and
South Omo.  The total target population (aged 2-30) is estimated at 5 568 506. The
appeal is for US$ 2.5 million to cover the cost of vaccine and autodestruct syringes, oily
chloramphenical and reagents, and training of health workers in case management and
epidemic response.   </span></p>
