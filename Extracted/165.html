<p>
<span><b>21 March 1997</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Lassa fever continues to occur in Kenema District following the outbreak during
1996.  Between November 1996 and 11 March 1997 a total of 239 cases were admitted to
hospital in Kenema District and  39 (16%) died.   Of these cases, 140 with 23 deaths had
occurred since 1 January 1997.  A WHO mission investigated the situation in Kenema District
from 14 to 21 February to redirect control activities, review existing surveillance activities
identify future needs and prepare a plan of action.  The cooperation of NGOs based in the area
such as MERLIN, UK, have resulted in  improved communications for a rapid patient referral.
Clinical care has also improved which has reduced case fatality rate among hospitalized cases. 
However, ribavirin for treatment of cases is in short supply and WHO is seeking sources for
additional supplies.</span></p>
