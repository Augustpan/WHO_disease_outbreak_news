<p>
<span><b>26 November 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>PAHO/WHO REPORT ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL
SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Cholera:</b> As of November 20, the Ministry of Public Health has reported six cases
and one death (San Alejo, La Union). V. cholera 01 El Tor Owaga has been isolated in one
  case. Of the six reported cases, four were imported from Jutiapa, Guatemala; the other two
  originated in border areas of El Salvador (Metepán, Santa Ana and San Alejo, La Unión.)
  On 19 November, an outbreak of diarrheal disease erupted in the San Juan de Dios Hospital
  in the department of Santa Ana on the Guatemala border. All fifteen cases required
  hospitalization. This is a suspected outbreak of cholera which is attributed to ingestion
  of food sold by a street vendor from Jutiapa, Guatemala. The Ministry of Health initiated
  a public information and health education campaign and launched activities to control the
  disease, targeting the areas along the Guatemala border.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Cholera:</b> The Surveillance Department of the Ministry of Health reported that
between 4-20 November there were 234 confirmed cases of cholera out of a total of 261
  reported. There were 17 deaths. On 20 November, an outbreak was reported in the Mental
  Health Hospital of Guatemala, with 18 confirmed cases and one death. In Chinaltenango that
  same day, there were 27 suspected cases and 37 confirmed cases, which correspond to the
  cumulative total notified cases for that area in the last two weeks. All reported
  outbreaks implied food-borne transmission.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Reporting by epidemiological weeks (through Week 45-November 14), as reported by the
Health Information Management System (SIGSA) on 19 November, shows a clear rise in cholera
  beginning in Week 37 (September 13). However, this information service reports 395 cases
  of cholera during Week 44 (November 1-7) and 511 cases during Week 45 (November 8-14),
  sharply higher than the figures reported by the Surveillance Department of the Ministry of
  Health. Diagnostic measures have been strengthened and treatment of cases and contacts
  stepped up.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Leptospirosis:</b> On 23 November, the Surveillance Department reported six cases of
leptospirosis, five of which were confirmed. Four of the cases occurred in Guatemala City
  and two in Escuintla. No deaths were reported. <b></b></span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Dengue: </b>SIGSA reports 277 cases of dengue for Week 45, a rise of almost 200
cases from the previous week.<b> </b></span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>Malaria:</strong> According to SIGSA, the situation is stable.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Cholera: </b>As of 22 November, the Ministry of Health reported 335 cases of
cholera, 301 of which were confirmed. Managua reported 156 cases or 52% , followed by
  Carazo (46 cases), Masaya (25) and Matagalpa (18 cases). According to an analysis of
  trends by the Epidemiological Surveillance System, one can observe an increase in Week 45,
  with 102 cases. Seventy-five were reported the preceding week. The Ministry of Health has
  taken measures to treat the cases, distribute chlorine, and conduct community education
  and environmental health campaigns.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Leptospirosis:</b> Up to 22 November, the Ministry of Health reported 264 suspected
cases of leptospirosis, 98.1% of which were in Chinandega and Estelí (136 and 123 cases
  respectively). Of the 182 samples processed in laboratories, 42 resulted positive for
  Leptospira (23%). The Ministry of Health is sending medical brigades and epidemiologists
  to the affected departments and strengthening control measures and community support.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Dengue:</b> The Ministry of Health reports a rise in notification of cases during
the last two weeks.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Malaria: </b>According to information from the Ministry, the situation is stable.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Cholera:</b> As of 21 November, the Ministry of Health reported three confirmed
cases of cholera and 11 suspected cases in Regions 1, 3 and 4 of the country.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Leptospirosis:</b> On 20 November, the Ministry of Health reported and outbreak of
febrile illness compatible with leptospirosis in three municipalities (San Pedro Zula,
  Choloma and La Lima in the department of Cortes (Region 3). Four cases were reported with
  three deaths. Two of the cases were serologically confirmed. The Ministry of Health has
  sent an epidemiological team to the field, strengthening the diagnostic capacity and
  improving epidemiological surveillance efforts.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Dengue:</b> As of 21 November, the Ministry reported 1,080 cases of classic dengue,
444 of which occurred in Region 3. A total of 33 suspected cases of hemorragic dengue have
  been analyzed, and 15 of these were confirmed. The remainder are being studied. To date, 4
  people have died.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Cholera:</b> Health authorities report, as of 20 November, an outbreak of cholera en
Saint Martin Village in the Cayo District, with 11 suspected cases and five confirmed. The
  latter have been hospitalized in the Belmopan Hospital. In one case, a 78-year-old person
  died 12 hours after being hospitalized. The suspected source of infection was contaminated
  drinking water from the Roaring Creek. Fifty-two contacts received treatment.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The following situations can be identified from available information: <ul>
<li>there is epidemic activity of cholera in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch.
      Guatemala has the highest risk. </li>
<li>there is epidemic activity of leptospirosis in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. The
      area at greatest risk is Estelí and Chinandega, Nicaragua. </li>
<li>there is epidemic activity of hemorragic dengue in the metropolitan region of Honduras. </li>
</ul></span></p>
<p>
<span>PAHO recognizes the extraordinary efforts of the local and national health authorities
in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch to control the risk of epidemics. These
  efforts, particularly the improved epidemiological surveillance, have sharply increased
  the capacity to suspect and detect cases as well as to confirm instances and eventually
  treat diseases that have the potential to cause epidemics. Consequently, we can expect a
  significant increase in the epidemiological reporting of cases in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p>
<span>However, PAHO recommends the immediate establishment of the following measures:</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Cholera:</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Strengthen health control measures, including basic hygiene measures, provision of
safe water, and handling and consumption of food from street vendors, among the at-risk
  population, particularly in shelters.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Intensify local epidemiological surveillance measures of cholera (active
identification of cases) in the affected population.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) Implement social communication campaigns particularly in shelters and among the
displaced population and native communities.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Leptospirosis:</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Strengthen the local capacity to diagnose and quickly treat cases.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Stimulate community participation in expanding the application of preventive
measures and the early detection of suspected cases.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) Step up health surveillance measures, including rodent control.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Hemorragic Dengue:</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Ensure that health authorities have prompt access to suspected cases.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Intensify health measures to control vectors.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) Strengthen local community participation in the control of breeding sites of
mosquitos.</span></p>
