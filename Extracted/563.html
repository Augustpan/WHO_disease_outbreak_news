<p>
<span><b>05 June 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The international team* has returned from the site of the
outbreak in Meherpur district (<a href="/csr/don/2001_05_30/en">see previous report</a>).
The team carried out detailed surveys in the affected area, investigating a cluster of
deaths that occurred between 26 April and 10 May 2001.  An extensive search revealed
that no new cases had occurred after mid-May. Laboratory tests are underway to try to
determine the etiology of the outbreak.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The team recommended that surveillance should be maintained
to detect any recurrence of a similar nature in Meherpur or elsewhere in the country.
  It was further recommended that the capacity to detect and respond rapidly to
outbreaks should be strengthened at both national and district levels through developing
guidelines, establishing and training a rapid response team, and maintaining appropriate
supplies and equipment for rapid response.</span></p>
