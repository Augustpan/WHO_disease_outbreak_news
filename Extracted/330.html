<p>
<span><b>07 April 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have
confirmed that of the 15 blood samples from abattoir workers received from Singapore for
  testing, 11 (including 1 death) tested positive for Hendra-like virus. No additional cases
  have been reported in Singapore during the past two weeks and the outbreak there has now
  ended.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The outbreak of encephalitis is still ongoing in Malaysia. For
up-to-date information on the number of cases and deaths, please see the web site of the Department of Public Health, Ministry of Health,
  Malaysia at: <a href="http://dph.gov.my/press/press2/cases.htm">http://dph.gov.my/press/press2/cases.htm</a></span></p>
<p>
<span>The Hendra-like virus is a new virus. It is similar to the Hendra virus which was
responsible for the deaths of two humans and some race horses in Australia in 1994.
  However, genetic analysis of the new virus shows significant differences. Experts at CDC
  have noted that transmission of the virus has been confined to persons who have had direct
  contact with infected pigs. Currently, there is no evidence that the virus can be
  transmitted from human to human. Travellers to Malaysia should be aware of this outbreak
  of febrile encephalitis, which thus far has involved only those closely associated with
  pig farms.  No travel restrictions are indicated at this time.</span></p>

Hendra-Like Virus - Malaysia and Singapore, 1998-1999" in <em>MMWR</em>, April 9,
