<h1 class="headline">1997 - Medical Impact of Use of Antimicrobial drugs in Food Animals</h1>
<p>
<span><b>28 March 1997</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO Consultation, Berlin, Germany, 13-17 October 1997.</span></p>
<p>
<span>There is increasing concern about the extent to which bacteria pathogenic in humans have
acquired resistance to antimicrobial drugs.  Use of antimicrobial drugs in food animals is  known
as potentially adding to the development of antimicrobial  resistance in bacteria of medical
relevance. However, the real scope of the medical impact of the use antimicrobials in livestock 
production is generally unknown.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO intends to organize a scientific consultation on the medical  impact of use of antimicrobial
drugs in food animals in October 1997  in Berlin. The objectives of the consultation are:</span></p>
<p>
<span><ul>
<li> to review the knowledge of the medical risks regarding  antimicrobial resistance in
	bacteria of public health significance  associated with the use of different antimicrobial
	drugs in food  animal production</li></ul></span></p>
<p>
<span><li> in the context of the development of the WHO Network on Antimicrobial Resistance
	Monitoring to define the needs on monitoring  of emergence, mechanisms of
	development and spread to man of   antimicrobial resistance in food and animals at
	national and  international levels</li></span></p>
<p>
<span><li> to obtain an international consensus on how to tackle the  identified problems.</li></span></p>
<p>
<span></span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO will invite about 25 experts in the field of emergence and  monitoring of antimicrobial
resistance, infectious control in  community settings as well as on feed additives, food animal
production and veterinary medicine, infectious disease control and  antimicrobial resistance
monitoring in animal and food production.</span></p>
