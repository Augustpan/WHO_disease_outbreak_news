<p>
<span><b>17 June 2003<br/><br/>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 30 May, 200 cases of typhoid and 40 deaths have been reported by the WHO Regional Office for the Americas (PAHO) and the Ministry of Health, Haiti. Three cases have been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The outbreak started in April during the dry season and affected remote villages in the Grand Bois Area, bordering the Dominican Republic. These villages lack access to health care facilities and to safe water; all water points in the area showed a maximum level of E.coli pollution. Most of the deaths occurred in persons who had no access to health care facilities.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In May, PAHO and the Ministry of Health sent a team to investigate and control the epidemic, including: sampling water points, establishing mobile clinics, laboratory testing of cases, providing health education, and organizing the response at the local level.</span></p>
