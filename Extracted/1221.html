<p>
<span>On 21 July 2006, German health authorities have reported to WHO an imported case of Lassa fever, confirmed by laboratory tests at the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute of Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The patient, resident in Sierra Leone, became ill with fever on 5 July 2006 and flew to Germany on 10 July 2006, where he arrived the following day.</span></p>
<p>
<span>He is currently being treated in isolation in Frankfurt and German health authorities have taken the appropriate measures to prevent further transmission of the virus.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Although the risk of transmission of Lassa virus to co-passengers is extremely low, an international contact tracing exercise, coordinated by the Robert Koch Institut, Berlin, Germany, is ongoing. The relevant flights are:</span></p>
<p>
<span>- 10 July 2006; SN Brussels Airlines; flight SN 207; from Freetown, Sierra Leone, via Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, to Brussels, Belgium;
<br/>- 11 July 2006; SN Brussels Airlines; flight SN 2607; from Brussels, Belgium to Frankfurt, Germany.</span></p>
