<h1 class="headline">1999 - Suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - Update 5</h1>
<p>
<span><b>17 May 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>One new case of Marburg virus infection have been confirmed by the laboratory at the
National Institute of Virology (South Africa). This case was a woman who died 7 May in the
  isolation unit of the health centre. She reportedly lived 20-30 km from Durba and
  preliminary investigation has not established a link with other haemorrhagic fever cases
  or with mining activities. Additional data about this case is being collected. The only
  previously confirmed case was the medical officer who died 23 April.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The special committee established in Watsa to coordinate the investigation now includes
experts from the Ministry of Health and local health authorities, WHO, Médecins sans
  frontières (Belgium and Holland), UNDP, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
  Institut Pasteur ( France, French Guiana and Madagascar) and the Institute of Tropical
  Medicine (Belgium). The committee has established teams for logistical support;
  surveillance; training local health staff in preventive and protective practices and
  educating the local population in these practices; and for conducting clinical,
  epidemiological, and virological research. The team aims to determine the original source
  of the outbreak, identify any further cases of suspected VHF, follow-up contacts of
  suspected cases and further implement control measures.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A large serological survey of inhabitants in the affected area began today. Also, an
ecological team, consisting of experts from the National Institute of Virology and the
  Danish Pest Infection Laboratory has started collecting specimens from animals for
  virological studies.</span></p>
