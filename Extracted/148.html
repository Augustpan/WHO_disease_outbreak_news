<h1 class="headline">1997 - Cholera in Somalia</h1>
<p>
<span><b>04 June 1997</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Data on the epidemic continue to be received from NGOs and
through the WHO office in Mogadishu.  The cumulative number of cases reported is now
5557 with 247 deaths (CFR 4.4%), but the real number of cases is believed to be higher, since
mild cases are excluded in the reports from most treatment centres, and in some areas
laboratory confirmation has not been possible due to logistical constraints and security
problems.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Suspected cholera outbreaks in areas of Middle Shabelle  and Galgaduud Regions have been
reported recently.  The epidemic in Mogadishu declined steadily up to mid-May but rose
again the following week and it is impossible to forecast the evolution of the outbreak in this
region at present. </span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO continued its support to NGOs and local authorities, supplying ORS, Ringers Lactate
and antibiotics.  Water chlorination and health education continue in local communities with
support from UNICEF, </span></p>
<p>
<span>Intensified efforts are still necessary to guarantee sufficient supplies to all NGOs involved
and to facilitate laboratory confirmation.  Continued vigilance is needed, especially in areas
not yet affected by this epidemic.</span></p>
