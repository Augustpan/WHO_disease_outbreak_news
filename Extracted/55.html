<h1 class="headline">1996 - Typhoid fever in Tajikistan</h1>
<p>
<span><b>02 August 1996</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Since May 1996, Tajikistan has faced an
outbreak of typhoid fever, resulting in nearly 4 000 cases
notified so far. Although access to diagnostic laboratory
materials is limited, most of these cases have been
identified as typhoid fever based on clinical diagnosis.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The outbreak is due to the overflow from old and poorly
maintained sewage systems after heavy rainfalls earlier
this year with subsequent contamination of drinking water
sources. Currently 10 districts in two provinces are
affected, and a continuation of the outbreak is likely as
30-40 new cases are reported every day.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A general shortage of drugs, IV fluids, ORS, antibiotics
and chlorine for treatment of drinking water, as well as
diagnostic materials aggravates  the situation.</span></p>
<p>
<span>So far the response of the Ministry of Health has included
the organization of visits of emergency teams to certain
districts and visits to houses which could be affected.
Health education materials are being distributed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>At the request of the Ministry of Health, WHO has
responded to the epidemic by sending an expert team to
Tajikistan to assess the situation.   Laboratory materials
and drugs for the treatment of 2 000 patients were
provided. The WHO expert team estimated the needs to
combat the outbreak over a 5-month period. UNICEF and
International Federation of the Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies (IFRC) are already supporting local
activities and some of the drugs and medical equipment
required will be provided by IFRC. </span></p>
