<h1 class="headline">1999 - Cholera, Democratic Republic of the Congo</h1>
<p>
<span><b>09 December 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Since the beginning of November, 74 cases of cholera and 4 deaths have been
reported in the areas of Kinshasa worst affected by current flooding of the Congo river
  and its tributaries. Investigations by the Ministry of Health with the collaboration of
  WHO are in progress and preventive and control measures are being implemented. Rising
  water levels have caused breakdowns in the water-supply system, resulting in a significant
  risk of contamination. Local authorities, with the help of NGOs, have already evacuated
  around 20Â 000 people. The current level of flooding is affecting an area inhabited by
  2 million people, and it is feared that the peak level has not yet been reached. The total
  population of Kinshasa is 7 million.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A crisis committee has been set up by the Minister of Health in which UN agencies,
intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations are participating. They are currently
  visiting the affected sites. An international response is being organized and some
  countries and agencies have already mobilized funds for the provision of food and other
  supplies.</span></p>
