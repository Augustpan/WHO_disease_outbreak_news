<span><b>22 October 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Between July and September 1998, an unidentified disease
caused around 100 deaths in a population of 2000 in four remote villages in Meyon,
  southern Sudan. As soon as the outbreak was reported to WHO, a team was sent to: describe
  the outbreak by standard epidemiological parameters; collect specimens to allow for
  laboratory identification of the causative agent; implement immediate control and
  preventive measures as necessary; and assess whether further assistance was required.
  Preliminary results suggest that the disease was pneumonia with a haemorrhagic component.</span></p>
