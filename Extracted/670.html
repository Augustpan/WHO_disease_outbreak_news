<h1 class="headline">2002 - Leishmaniasis in Afghanistan</h1>
<p>
<span><b>22 May 2002</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>In collaboration with the Ministry of Health of Afghanistan
and nongovernmental organizations including Health Net International (HNI) and TODAI, WHO
has recently carried out an evaluation of the situation regarding cutaneous leishmaniasis
(CL) in Kabul.  The situation in Kabul appears to be particularly severe, with an
estimated 200 000 cases of CL.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Although CL is not a lethal disease, it carries a high
burden of social stigma. Movements of populations both within the country and across
borders due to the consequences of ongoing conflicts are expected to increase the
incidence of the disease within the coming months. CL has been endemic in Afghanistan for
several years, with foci of zoonotic (animal reservoir to man) transmission mainly in the
northern provinces and with anthroponotic transmission (human to human) typically
involving large cities.</span></p>
<p>
<span>An emergency plan of action is being developed by WHO and
other partners to control the situation by the end of 2003, at least in Kabul. Priority
interventions include provision of impregnated bednets, early treatment of cases with
first line drugs, recruitment and training of intervention teams, and health education.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO has already provided drugs for the treatment of 35 000
cases.  In collaboration with HNI, WHO has also provided impregnated bednets for
protection against the sandfly vector.</span></p>
