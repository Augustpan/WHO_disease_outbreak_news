<p>
<em class="dateline">29 September 2008 -</em>
<span>More than 54,000 infants and young children have sought medical treatment in relation to the melamine-contaminated dairy products in China, causing kidney stone. Three deaths among infants have been confirmed, more than 13,000 infants are in hospital. Kidney stones in infants are normally very rare.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The World Health Organization has published <i><a href="https://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/Melamine.pdf">“Melamine and Cyanuric acid: Toxicity, Preliminary Risk Assessment and Guidance on Levels in Food”</a></i>. This preliminary guidance was developed to assist national authorities in the decision-making process on deciding possible health concern of melamine levels in food. </span></p>
<p>
<span>This preliminary guidance is proposed as a first pragmatic approach until more data become available which would allow a more detailed assessment.
