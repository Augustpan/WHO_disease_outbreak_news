<span>PAHO/WHO has received notification of a laboratory-confirmed autochthonous case of Zika virus infection in Guatemala. The case, who is a resident of the Zacapa department, developed symptoms on 11 November. An investigation is being carried out to detect further cases. The confirmatory testing was performed at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Fort Collins. Guatemalan health authorities are implementing the corresponding prevention and control activities.</span></p>
<h3 class="section_head1">WHO advice</h3>
<p>
<span>Given the increased transmission of Zika virus in the Region of the Americas, PAHO/WHO recommends that its Member States establish and maintain the capacity to detect and confirm cases of Zika virus infection, prepare their health services for a potential additional burden at all levels of health care, and implement an effective public communications strategy to reduce the mosquitoes that transmit this disease, particularly in areas where this vector is present. The complete set of recommendations is available in the latest Epidemiological Update (see related links).</span></p>
