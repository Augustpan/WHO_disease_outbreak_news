<span><b>17 February 2006</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health in Iraq has confirmed the country’s second case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 39-year-old man from the northern province of Sulaimaniyah. He developed symptoms on 18 January and died on 27 January.</span></p>
<p>
<span>He was the uncle of the country’s initial case, a 15-year-old girl who died 17 January, and provided care for her during her illness. He also had a documented history of exposure to infected domestic birds.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Problems with the shipment of patient specimens for external diagnostic confirmation have been solved. Samples from an initial 15 patients under investigation for possible infection were tested today at a US Naval Medical Research Unit located in Cairo, Egypt. Apart from the 39-year-old fatal case, all test results were negative.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A second shipment of samples from additional patients under investigation arrived yesterday in Cairo. Results are expected within the next few days.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Duplicate samples are being sent to a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom for further testing and analysis.</span></p>
