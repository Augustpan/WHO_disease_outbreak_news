<p>
<span>From 1 January 2004 to 22 March 2004, the Ministry of Health has reported a total of 40 337 cases, including 507 deaths, mainly from provinces in Java, with 35% of the cases being reported from DKI Jakarta. (<a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_03_05/en/"> see previous report</a>).</span></p>
<p>
<span>Based on data received to date it appears that the outbreak may have peaked in Jakarta, Jawa Tenggah and Nusa Tenggara Timur provinces. However, in Jawa Barat, Bali, Sumatera Selatan, Lampung, Kalimantan Timur, Sulawesi Seltan and Nusa Tenggara Barat provinces, the number of monthly reported cases still appears to be on the rise.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The local health authorities are conducting intensive vector control activities including larviciding, space spraying and mobilizing the communities to reduce the Aedes breeding containers. The Ministry of Health is providing free hospital care to those patients presenting with symptoms of dengue and without adequate financial resources.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO is working with the Ministry of Health and providing support with laboratory diagnostics.</span></p>
