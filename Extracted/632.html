<p>
<span>As of 1 September 2002 WHO has received reports of 661 cases of
cholera in Montserado County. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare met with WHO, UNICEF, Médecins sans Frontières
(MSF Belgium ) and other nongovernmental organizations to discuss measures to contain the outbreak.
  As a result, a team from the Ministry of Health and WHO assessed the
epidemiological situation in the county, including the camps for internally displaced
persons (IDPs).</span></p>
<p>
<span>The team recommended chlorinating of water in and around Monrovia as
well as in the IDP camps.  Community-based health promotion activities in the
affected areas were also recommended. </span></p>
