<span><b>25 August 2005</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 23 August, 7 cases of polio have been reported. Five provinces have been affected: Bengo, Benguela, Luanda, Lunda Sul, Moxico. The most recent case, in Benguela, had an onset of 12 July. This case occurred before the first National Immunization Day (NID) campaign on 29 July.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A second NID will be held tomorrow, 26 August. In order to ensure rapid interruption of the virus transmission in Angola, a third round of NIDs has been planned for late September 2005. The partners in the Polio Eradication Initiative in Angola have asked the <a href="http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/PolioSpecialAlertAugust2005.pdf">international community for financial support</a> to help them carry out this campaign.</span></p>
