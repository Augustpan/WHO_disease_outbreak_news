<p>
<span><b>17 January 1997</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span></span></p>
<p>
<span>The recent Cholera outbreak which occurred in Rumonge, in the south of the country
bordering Lake Tanganyika, is continuing and up to 13 January a total of 482 cases with 21
deaths have been reported.  The breakdown of water supplies after the affected village was the
target of an armed group, continuing poor hygiene practices and an increase in the number of
displaced persons in the area have all contributed to this outbreak.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A national cholera control committee has been established with the support of WHO and other
agencies.  A plan of action which puts emphasis on improved case management, surveillance and
prevention of the spread of the disease has been prepared together with a request by the
government to WHO for acute basic needs.</span></p>
