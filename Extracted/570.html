<h1 class="headline">2001 - Meningococcal disease, serogroup W135 - Update</h1>
<p>
<span><b>16 May 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>During 2001 the following countries have reported
cases of W135 meningococcal disease to WHO; most cases are associated with international
travel or contact with travellers to Saudi Arabia:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Burkina Faso: 4 cases have been reported.  <i>N.
meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed. Travel/contact history of
cases is not yet known.</span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>Central African Republic</strong>: 3 cases (Haj
pilgrims) have been reported. <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory
confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>Denmark:</strong> 2 cases (one case close contact
with Haj pilgrims, the travel/contact history of the second case is not yet known)have
been reported.  <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>France</b>: 2 cases (close contacts with Haj pilgrims)
have been reported. <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Norway: 4 cases (2 contacts with Haj pilgrims) have

<p>
<span><b>Saudi Arabia</b>: 109 cases (predominantly Haj pilgrims
from outside Saudi Arabia) including 35 deaths have been reported between 9 February and
22 March 2001. <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed in more
than half of the cases.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Singapore: 4 cases (3 close contacts with Haj pilgrims,
1 history of travel to Saudi Arabia), including 1 death have been reported. Two of the
cases occurred in January 2001, before the main period of pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. <i>N.

<p>
<span><b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</b>:

<p>
<span>Meningococcal disease. As with all types of
meningococcal disease, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. The symptoms of group
W135 meningococcal disease are the same as for other groups of the disease: sudden onset
of intense headache, high fever, nausea, and vomiting, photophobia and stiff neck. The
most severe clinical form of the disease, meningococcal septicaemia can be presented by
abrupt onset, high fever, petechial rash or purpura.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO recommends that chemoprophylaxis be given to close
contacts of the cases, such as persons sleeping in the same dwelling. In most countries
rifampicin is recommended.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In preparation for the Umrah and the Haj seasons for next
year, the Ministry of Health of the Government of Saudi Arabia has notified the Ministries
of Health of all countries from which pilgrims arrive, that the vaccination against
meningococcal meningitis with the quadrivalent vaccine (serogroups A,C, Y and W135) has
been added to the health requirements for arrivals coming to the Umrah and Haj.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO encourages national reference laboratories to closely
monitor meningococcal disease.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In order to fully identify and follow the epidemiological
spread of the W135 strain, WHO encourages countries to send specimens to WHO Collaborating
Centres for Meningococcal Infections. The Centres are:</span></p>
