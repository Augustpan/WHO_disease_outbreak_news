<span><b>26 July 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The 48 year-old surgeon who was infected with Lassa fever
virus while working in Kenema, Sierra Leone died on 25 July in Leiden University Hospital,
The Netherlands where he was being treated. He was initially treated for malaria in Sierra
Leone on 11 July, and then traveled to The Netherlands (arrived 14 July) to visit
relatives. He was admitted to the hospital on 15 July. Lassa fever was suspected when his
condition worsened on 20 July and treatment with ribavirin was started. On 22 July, the
Bernard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany reported that Lassa
virus was detected in a blood sample sent for diagnostic testing.</span></p>
<p>
<span>While the risk of infection for those who traveled with
this person from Freetown to Amsterdam is minimal, potential contacts are being traced and
monitored in both The Netherlands as well as in Africa.</span></p>
