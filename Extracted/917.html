<p>
<span>WHO has received informal reports of a laboratory-confirmed fatal case of influenza A H5 infection in Viet Nam. The patient is thought to be a child who was hospitalized in Hanoi and who died over the weekend. Further details are awaited from official sources.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Detection of an H5 subtype of influenza A in a human should always arouse a very high level of suspicion that the case was caused by the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, particularly in a country with ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry. H5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype that has ever been shown to cause disease in humans.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Since August, Viet Nam has detected four human cases of H5 infection. These cases have occurred amidst recurring H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in several Asian countries.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Since January of this year, altogether 39 human cases have been reported from two countries, Viet Nam and Thailand. Of these cases, 28 have been fatal.</span></p>
