<span><b>19 August 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>In addition to the seasonal pattern of
cholera in this region, extremely heavy rainfalls and floods this year have contributed to
  an increase in both cholera cases and deaths as well as an increased risk of waterborne
  epidemics in general. WHO is concerned about this situation and, through its regional
  offices, has alerted Ministries of Health in the region to strengthen cholera preparedness
  activities including keeping stocks of medicine in reserve, training, health education and
  setting up cholera task forces, in collaboration with agencies already in place .</span></p>
