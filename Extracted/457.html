<h1 class="headline">2000 - Cholera in Somalia</h1>
<p>
<span><b>02 May 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>From 1 January to 21 April 2000, 2 232 cases of
cholera and 230 deaths have been reported. Cases have been confirmed in Bay, Lower Juba,
Lower Shabelle, Mogadishu and Mudug. In areas where international teams are present, the
case-fatality rate is lower due to effective case management and the implementation of
adequate control measures. It should be noted however that cholera control in Somalia is
complex and difficult as a result of problems of security, accessibility and the recent
drought.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO continues to carry out cholera control coordination
activities through the cholera task force, which collects and compiles data to be shared
with partners, assists in processing stool samples, provides cholera supplies as required
and gives training support. Agencies involved include: UNICEF, <i>Action internationale
contre la faim</i>, the International Medical Corps, <i>Médecins sans frontières</i>,
the Coordinating Committee of the Organization for Voluntary Services and the Somali Red
Crescent Society.</span></p>
