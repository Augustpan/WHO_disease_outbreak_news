<span>The majority of these cases are from the provinces in Java, South Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, Bali, East and West Nusa Tenggara and Aceh. Den-3 is the most common serotype circulating, although all four serotypes are present. The health authorities are carrying out tests to determine the specific virus strain responsible for this outbreak. The government is providing free hospital treatment to those dengue patients who cannot afford it.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The local health authorities are conducting intensive vector control activities including larviciding, space spraying and sensitizing the community on how to protect themselves and the actions they can take to prevent the mosquitoes from breeding in and around their homes.</span></p>
