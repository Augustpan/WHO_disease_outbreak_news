outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in the Boou√© region had
been confirmed by isolation by the WHO Collaborating
Centre at the Pasteur Institute, Paris.  The isolates were
very similar to those isolated from the blood of patients in
Mayibout in February 1996.  Serological results of IgG and
IgM ELISA tests showed that infection without clinical
symptoms occurred among the contacts.</span></p>

<span>As at 25 November, 27 cases have been identified in the
outbreak which started in late July.  This includes two fatal
cases detected through contract tracing of the Gabonese
patient treated in South Africa in October.  The total
number of deaths is 19, the last death dates back to 5
November.   The declaration of the end of the outbreak will
be 42 days after the last death, i.e. 17 December if no
further deaths are registered. </span></p>
