<h1 class="headline">1996 - Ebola-like Reston virus in monkeys</h1>
<p>
<span><b>17 April 1996</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Reston virus, a filovirus closely related to Ebola virus has been isolated from two non-
human primates (<i>Cynomolgus</i>) held at a quarantine facility in Texas, USA.  One animal was dead
and the other sick when sampled.  The monkeys had been imported from the Philippines.  At
present there is no indication of associated human disease.  A team from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention is conducting further investigations on site.</span></p>
<p>
<span>	Reston virus was first discovered in 1989 in monkeys imported from the Philippines
which had died in a holding facility in Reston, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. , USA.
While monkeys suffer a severe disease often leading to death, the limited information available
indicates that humans may not become clinically ill.  However, this is based only on the isolation
of Reston virus from one asymptomatically infected animal handler identified during the original
outbreak and a few seroconversions that were not associated with clinical disease.</span></p>
<p>
<span>	A formal quarantine procedure for imported monkeys was developed following the
original Reston episode and it is this system that apparently identified the current cases.</span></p>
