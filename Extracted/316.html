<span><b>23 June 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Africa</span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>Burundi. </strong>Following notification of an increase in cholera cases at the
main hospital by the chief of the Rumonge health district, a team from <em>Médecins sans
frontières </em>and WHO went to the area to investigate and to initiate control measures.</span></p>
<p>
<span>From 24 May to 5 June a total of 89 cases with 6 deaths had occurred. No cases have
been reported among the refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who passed
through the area during that period. The cause of the outbreak was probably the early
onset of the dry season and consequent drinking of water from the lake, as well as lack of
prevention measures by the population. Action was taken to provide ORS and medicaments as
well as clean water by truck. Epidemiological surveillance was also strengthened. A
committee met to mobilise the resources and to coordinate the measures of the aid
agencies.</span></p>

beginning of the year. </span></p>
