<p>
<span><b>23 September 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone confirmed
today that the current outbreak of cholera affecting the country is caused by <em>Vibrio
  cholerae</em> O1 El Tor, which was identified and confirmed by the Pasteur Institute in
  Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.  As of 16 September 1770 cases and 55 deaths were registered.
    Although some cases of <em>V. cholerae</em> non-O1 were also identified, tests for
  isolation of <i>V. cholerae </i>O139 were negative.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health and Sanitation, with support from several agencies, took
measures to identify quickly the causing agent and formulate strategies to control the
  outbreak.  Surveillance activities, diarrhoea treatment centres and health education
  on personal and environmental hygiene have already contributed to a reduction in the
  number of deaths.</span></p>
