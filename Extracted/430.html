<h1 class="headline">2000 - Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome in Yemen</h1>
<p>
<span><b>26 September 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The Yemen Ministry of Health has reported 113 human cases,
including 30 deaths of suspected Rift Valley fever in Wadi Mawr, Al-Hudaydah Governorate
in northern Yemen.  266 animal deaths have also been reported, mainly of sheep and
goats but some cattle and camels have been affected.  The first case occurred on 10
September. </span></p>
<p>
<span>The Minister of Health has formed an Epidemic Committee
consisting of the Ministries of Health and Agriculture, and a team of international
experts from WHO, the United States Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU 2 - a WHO
Collaborating Centre in Egypt) and epidemiologists and laboratorians from Oman.  An
expert from The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) will be joining
the team shortly.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A laboratory is being set up in the outbreak zone to
analyse all human and animal samples collected there.  The team will carry out
further field investigations, entomological and ecological studies. They will also assist
in implementing control measures, including case management and health education. 
The Yemen government has already established a Helpline for health workers and the general
public.   </span></p>
<p>
<span>There is a current outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Saudi
Arabia in the area bordering Yemen (<a href="/csr/don/2000_09_18/en">see previous report</a>) and
this acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome in Yemen may be related.  Relevant government
ministries in both countries are coordinating efforts to ensure a joint approach to
outbreak investigations and response activities.</span></p>
