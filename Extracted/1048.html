<p>
<span>This case is the nephew of the <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_10_10/en/">21-year-old man</a> from Lampung, who was reported on 10 October 2005. Although the two cases are related and lived in the same neighbourhood, human-to-human transmission is considered unlikely.</span></p>
