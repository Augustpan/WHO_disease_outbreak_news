<p>
<span>The new case is a 40-year old director of a hospital and practicing physician from Guangzhou, Guangdong Province who developed symptoms of SARS on 7 January 2004. He was admitted to a hospital in Guangdong with pneumonia on 16 January and placed in respiratory isolation on the suspicion of SARS. He has made a full recovery and was discharged home on 30 January.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In accordance with <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/sars/guidelines/en/WHOSARSReferenceLab.pdf"> WHO recommendations</a> for SARS-CoV testing in the inter-epidemic period, the results of SARS-CoV testing performed at the national reference laboratory in Beijing were verified by a WHO SARS International Reference and Verification Network laboratory in Hong Kong.</span></p>
