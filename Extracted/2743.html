<h3 class="section_head1">Public health response</h3>
<p>
<span>The following public health response measures have been implemented:</span></p>
<ul class="disc">
<ul class="disc">
<li>With the support of WHO, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) activated the national Cholera Task Force on 10 September;</li>
<li>WHO has deployed a technical team to assist FMoH with coordination of response and development of response strategy on the ground;</li>
<li>Surveillance and reporting system have been strengthened by the distribution of case definitions and case investigation forms, active case finding and maintaining the line list;</li>
<li>Activation of 14 Cholera Treatment Centres by MoH, 4 in Blue Nile State and 10 in Sinnar State,  and standardization of case management protocols;</li>
<li>FMoH, WHO, and partners have provided cholera kits (enough to treat 200 people) with three additional kits (enough to treat 300 people) in the pipeline;</li>
<li>WHO is supporting the water quality surveillance system, water sampling, and testing, and infection prevention &amp; control activities;</li>

</ul>
</ul>
<h3 class="section_head1">WHO risk assessment</h3>
<p>
<span>Sudan is facing a continuous surge of suspected cholera cases since 2016. The current outbreak was reported following recent severe rainstorms and flooding in 15 out of 18 States. With the ongoing flooding and widespread damage to infrastructure, there is a concern that cases may further increase.  Although Blue Nile State shares borders with Ethiopia and South Sudan, there is currently no evidence of cross-border spread of the outbreak. However,the risk of spread is of more concern in the areas situated down the river Nile (including Khartoum). The Government swiftly responded to the detection of cases and necessary control measures are being implemented by national authorities, with support from partners, to contain the outbreak</span></p>
<h3 class="section_head1">WHO advice</h3>
<p>
<span>WHO recommends proper and timely case management. Improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Key public health communication messages should be provided to the population. Vaccination should be considered to complement the core prevention and control activities and help prevent the spread of the outbreak. </span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Sudan based on the currently available information.</span></p>
