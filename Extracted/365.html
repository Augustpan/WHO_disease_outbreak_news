<h1 class="headline">1999- Cholera in Somalia</h1>
<p>
<span><b>12 March 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Cholera has occurred seasonally in the country for a number of years and usually starts
in late November/early December ending around May. In the first week of December 1998
  cholera was reported in Mogadishu (Banadir Region) and since then several regions have
  reported cases.The other regions currently affected are Bay, Gedo, Lower Juba and Lower
  Shabelle. A total of 4 457 cases with 166 deaths have been reported since December up to
  19 February.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The epidemic is occurring in communities already weakened by severe shortage of food
and in areas where only polluted water is available as wells have dried up. Supplies for
  treatment have been made available by WHO to UNICEF. The UN agencies, NGOs and the local
  health authorities are all collaborating in dealing with the epidemic. As well as clinical
  case management, efforts have also been directed at preventive measures such as
  chlorination of public water sources and health education on personal hygiene.</span></p>
<p>
<span>At present, tests for cholera can be conducted in four laboratories (Merka in Lower
Shabelle Region, Mogadishu in Banadir Region, Bosasso in Bari Region and Hargeisa in
  Galbeed Region). All these laboratories are staffed by nationals trained by WHO.</span></p>
<p>
<span>As it is difficult to predict how long this epidemic will last or how much it will
spread. The cholera supplies that have been made available may be exhausted and there may
  well be a need for more supplies, and consequently for the support of the international
  community.</span></p>
