<h1 class="headline">2000 - Lassa fever in Germany</h1>
<p>
<span><b>13 January 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health of Bavaria has informed WHO that the diagnosis of Lassa
fever in a 23-year-old female student has been confirmed by PCR and virus culture
performed at the Bernard Nocht Institute in Hamburg.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The student reportedly had spent November and December in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. She
returned to Germany on 7 January via Lisbon, Portugal and was immediately admitted to a
general hospital with fever and flu-like symptoms. Her condition deteriorated rapidly and
after 4 days she was transferred to the Tropical Medicine Department of Würzburg Hospital
where she is being treated in an isolation ward.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Although the risk of transmission to others is considered to be minimal (requires
contact with blood or body fluids), possible contacts are being investigated. German
authorities have issued notices to passengers who traveled on the same flight from
Portugal to Germany asking them to contact health officials if they become ill. WHO is
working with Portuguese health authorities to trace possible contacts during the student's
travel to and in Portugal.</span></p>
