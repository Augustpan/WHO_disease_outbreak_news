<h1 class="headline">2002 - Acute respiratory syndrome in Democratic Republic of the Congo - Update</h1>
<p>
<span><b>12 December 2002</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 11 December the outbreak
has affected Bosobolo, Gbadolite, Gemena, and Karawa
areas  (<a href="/csr/don/2002_11_29a/en">see 
previous report</a>).</span></p>
<p>
<span>Because of persisting communications problems with health
personnel in the field, comprehensive surveillance data for the affected areas 
has been difficult to obtain. However, WHO reported the
preliminary results of a
retrospective survey conducted by Epicentre and Médecins sans Frontières 
(MSF-France) in Bosobolo covering 
approximately 300 households.
A total of  1 245 cases 
including 18 deaths (case-fatality rate 1.4%) was recorded. 
The attack rate was 47%. </span></p>
<p>
<span>The outbreak in the surveyed area peaked by early November
. All age groups have been affected with the highest case fatality rate over 3% 
observed in children under 5 years of age and the elderly. 
Preliminary results of blood samples tested at Institut Pasteur (Paris) indicate<i><b>
</b></i>recent infection compatible with the current circulating influenza virus 
(H3N2). <i><b> </b></i>Further testing to characterize 
the virus is necessary.

<span>WHO, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF- Belgium
), MEMISA, and FOMETRO are supporting the Ministry of Health in laboratory 
diagnosis and provision of supplies.</span></p>
