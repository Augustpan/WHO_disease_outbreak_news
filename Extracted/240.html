<span>According to a statement from the European Commission,
they have decided to lift the ban on fresh fish imports from eastern Africa imposed after
  a cholera epidemic. The decision affects imports from Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and
  Mozambique. The decision is effective 1 July 1998 and reverses earlier measures imposed in
  January 1998 to limit the import of fishery products because of the cholera epidemic that
  swept much of eastern Africa in late 1997 and early 1998.</span></p>
