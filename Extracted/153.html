<span>Since the end of January, a cholera outbreak with increasing
numbers of cases and deaths has occurred in the country.  The first cases reported were in Dar
es Salaam and then spread to seven other areas.  <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> El Tor Ogawa has been
confirmed.   As of 30 April 1997, nearly 3000 cases with over 100 deaths had been reported.
These reports only related to cases which were admitted to hospitals.   Cholera cases were
also reported in Zanzibar where there were 30 cases with 2 deaths since the end of March.</span></p>

<span>The Tanzanian Government, WHO and UNICEF are organising an emergency strategy to
combat cholera.   WHO will also provide US $15 000 to assist the government to implement
control activities (health education, training etc.) and to purchase supplies and equipment.  
WHO will send consultants to provide technical support if requested by the government.</span></p>
