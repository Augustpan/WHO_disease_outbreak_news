<h1 class="headline">1996 - Yellow fever in travellers</h1>
<p>
<span><b>31 October 1996</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Reports have been received of two travellers to the
Amazone region in Brazil who died from yellow fever after their return to their respective
home countries, Switzerland (April 1996) and the USA (August 1996). Neither had been
vaccinated against yellow fever. These incidents show how important it is for travellers
to yellow fever endemic zones to be vaccinated. As stated in the International Travel
and Health, Brazil recommends vaccination for travellers to rural areas in Acre, Amap,
Amazonas, Gois, Maranho, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Par, Rondnia and
Roraima States. Further advice on yellow fever vaccination and endemic areas are
available in <a href="http://www.iss.it/yellow"><i>International Travel and Health</i></a> which is updated annually and now
accessible on World Wide Web.</span></p>
