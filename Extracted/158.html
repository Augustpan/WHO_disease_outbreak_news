<h1 class="headline">1997 - Cholera in Somalia</h1>
<p>
<span><b>15 April 1997</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Outbreaks of acute diarrhoea and  cholera have continued to occur in various parts
of the country since late 1997.   Cholera has been confirmed and continues to be reported in
Mogadishu and Merca and new outbreaks were reported in Lower Shabelle region.  The total
number of cholera cases (including suspect cases)  reported since the first case on 30
November 1997 is 1535 with 47 deaths.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The number of cases in Mogadishu  North has  almost tripled in the last weeks following
recent heavy rainfalls, according to the latest report from the WHO country representative. 
Although the treatment centre there is coping well with the increased cases,   medical supplies
are  running short and WHO is trying to purchase these elsewhere.  ECHO (European
Community for Humanitarian Action) is also providing support and sending supplies.  A
WHO consultant who was already in Mogadishu to study cholera transmission there and to
assist in setting up a cholera committee   will now extend his stay to help deal with the
increasing number of cases there.  However, in recently affected rural areas coordination of
control activities is difficult.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Based on trends of cholera outbreaks in previous years, a decline in numbers is expected in
the next six to eight weeks.  The remote areas affected will continue to be difficult to reach 
because of  insecurity and logistical constraints.   Cholera task forces meet regularly to review
the situation. </span></p>
