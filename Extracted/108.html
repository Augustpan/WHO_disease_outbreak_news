<h1 class="headline">1996 - Yellow fever in Liberia</h1>
<p>
<span><b>02 February 1996</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The following areas have now confirmed cases of yellow fever (figures not yet available) and
have been added to the infected area list: Tubmanburg (Boma County), Salala (Bong
County), and Greenville (Sinoe County).  Supect cases have been reported from Margibi,
Monserado and Grand Gedeh Counties.  The immunization campaign is continuing in all
these areas as well as in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Information posted on 19 December 1995:  A summary of the yellow fever outbreak by the
country team, UNDP and WHO reports 359 cases of yellow fever, 9 deaths in Buchanan.  The
true number of cases is probably higher given the level of under reporting.  One case has also
been confirmed in Bong County.  A few suspected cases have been reported in the capital,
Monrovia, in Cape Mount, Grand Gedeh and Maryland.  The reports on suspected cases in
Lofa County were not confirmed by the WHO investigation team which went to the area from
6-11 December.   The vaccination campaign in Buchanan which started on 24 November was
completed during the second week of December.   A vaccination campaign to cover the
population in Morovia will start shortly.   The Government is supported in the campaigns to
vaccinate and inform the population by Médecins sans Frontièrs (Belgium &amp; France),
UNICEF, WHO and the Norwegian Government. (19.12.95)</span></p>

<span>Yellow fever vaccination certificate is required from all travellers over one year of age going
to Liberia.  (See also note in <i>Weekly Epidemiological Record</i>  No. 50, 15 December 1995).</span></p>
