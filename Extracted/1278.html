<p>
<span><b>10 March 2006</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an additional case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 4-year-old boy from Semerang, Central Java. He developed symptoms (fever) on 10 February and died on 28 February.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A joint investigation involving provincial health and agricultural authorities found that chickens had died in the boy’s neighbourhood in the days preceding symptom onset. No other human cases were identified in the family or neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The newly confirmed case brings the total in Indonesia to 28. Of these, 21 were fatal.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Agricultural authorities have reported a recent increase in the number of poultry deaths in Central and East Java. These reports have led to heightened awareness of the risk of human cases and a higher level of clinical suspicion when patients present with respiratory symptoms.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health and WHO are monitoring the situation closely. Many patients under investigation have subsequently been ruled out by tests conducted at local and WHO-affiliated laboratories.</span></p>
