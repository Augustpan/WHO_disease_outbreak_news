<h1 class="headline">2000 - Imported case of Lassa fever in the Netherlands</h1>
<p>
<span><b>25 July 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Health officials in The Netherlands recently notified WHO about an imported case of
Lassa fever. A man, working as a surgeon in Sierra Leone (outside the capital Freetown)
became ill with fever on 11 July, returned to The Netherlands the following day and was
hospitalized. On 22 July, the virologic diagnosis of Lassa fever was confirmed by the
Bernard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany. The Dutch health
authorities have taken the appropriate measures to prevent transmission of the virus from
the infected patient.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The patient traveled from Freetown to Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire via Monrovia, Liberia and
then to Amsterdam. The airline company that brought the patient from Abidjan to Amsterdam
has been informed and will notify passengers that have been seated close to the patient,
and the cabin attendants. WHO is contacting the airline that transported the patient in
Africa.</span></p>
