<h1 class="headline">1998 - Malaria in the United Republic of Tanzania.</h1>
<p>
<span><b>28 May 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Since January 1998, 13,440 cholera cases and 778 deaths
have been reported in the <b>Democratic Republic of the Congo</b>. The provinces of
    Katanga, Nord-Kivu, Sud-Kivu and Orientale are currently the most affected by cholera
    outbreaks. The provinces of Kinsasha and Equateur have reported only a few cases. Although
    the outbreak is in regression in the province of Katanga, the situation in Sud- Kivu,
    Nord-Kivu and Orientale provinces is still of serious concern. Many activities to prevent
    further spread and to treat affected populations are being undertaken by the MOH in
    collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, MSF and other NGO's.</span></p>
<p>
<span>From 1 April to 18 May, 77 cases of cholera and 3 deaths have been reported in
Bujumbura Province, <b>Burundi</b>. The districts of Buyenzi, Bwiza, Cibitoke and Musaga
    are the most affected. Health education and activities to improve sanitation are being
    carried out by the MOH.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Cases of cholera started to be reported in <b>Rwanda </b>in March in Cyangugu
prefecture which is on the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although the
    number of cases is not very high at present, there is major concern about further spread
    to other areas of the country.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In <b>Uganda</b>, the dramatic cholera outbreak which started in late 1997 is still
affecting the country with over 20,000 cases and over 1,000 deaths reported since the
    beginning of the year.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The current cholera outbreak affecting the Great Lakes region confirms earlier
forecasts of a potential spread from eastern African countries which were affected by
    major outbreaks last year to countries in the central and southern part of Africa.</span></p>
