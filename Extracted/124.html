<p>
<span>According to a report of the Ministry of Health, 346 cases of cholera with 14 deaths (5%) had
been reported up to 27 September.  The cases have mainly been reported in five quarters of
Maputo city (Chamanculo, Mafalala, Polana Cani√ßo, Maxaquene and Zona Verde), all with
very poor sanitary conditions and problems with safe water.  Up to now no other province of
the country has notified cases and Maputo city is the only area affected in the country.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Control activities through the Ministry of Health include mass media messages, community
based activities, house-to-house visits and treatment of cases.  The Ministry also coordinates
activities with the institutions responsible for sanitation and water supply and is
recommending further government action to improve sanitiation in the affected quarters.  
WHO has financially supported the education campaigns and other community activities
while UNICEF has provided 80 cholera kits with 320 more kits expected to arrive soon.  The
National Cholera Commission is meeting weekly and includes representatives of both WHO
and UNICEF.</span></p>
