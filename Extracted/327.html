<h1 class="headline">1999 - Cholera in Nigeria</h1>
<p>
<span><b>12 May 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>An outbreak of cholera has been reported in Kano Municipal Local Government Area (LGA),
Kano State, which started in late March. The outbreak was traced to the interruption of
the domestic water supply for some days which forced people to use any water available. A
total of 815 cases with 28 deaths has been recorded up to 6 May. The outbreak has now
spread to Tofa LGA where 182 cases with 19 deaths were recorded over two weeks beginning
in late April. Control measures including management and isolation of affected patients,
intensification of health education and chlorination of all wells in affected communities
have been taken. WHO gave technical support during the investigation and management of the
outbreak as well as emergency health kits.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Cholera outbreaks also occurred recently in Adamawa State (76 cases, 18 deaths) and in
Edo State (49 cases 24 deaths). The outbreak in Adamawa State is now under control and no
new cases have been reported in May. In Edo State technical assistance and transportation
for the investigative team was given by WHO but basic drugs and supplies for management of
patients were not available which led to the high case fatality rate.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Medecins sans fronti√®res (MSF), Holland, has set up a temporary treatment centre
and 6 Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) centres, and are currently organizing a widespread
health education campaign and training of local district health personnel.</span></p>
