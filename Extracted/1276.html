<span><b>13 March 2006</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an additional case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 12-year-old girl from Boyolali, Central Java. She developed symptoms (fever) on 19 February, was hospitalized on 23 February, and died on 1 March. Chickens in her household died in the days preceding symptom onset.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The girl’s 10-year-old brother also fell ill on 19 February and died on 28 February. As his symptoms were compatible with a clinical diagnosis of dengue haemorrhagic fever, no testing for H5N1 was carried out. It will therefore never be known whether he may have died following co-infection with dengue and H5N1 avian influenza.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A local investigation was conducted and no additional cases or symptomatic contacts were found. Rapid tests detected the H5 virus subtype in chickens from the children’s household.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The newly confirmed case brings the total in Indonesia to 29. Of these, 22 were fatal.</span></p>
