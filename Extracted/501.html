<span><b>12 December 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>NOTE FOR THE PRESS ISSUED BY WHO</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>12 DECEMBER 2001</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>WHO Coordinates International
Response to Outbreak of Ebola in Gabon </strong></span></p>
<p>
<span> Geneva  A team of scientists from the World Health Organization (WHO) and
its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network has arrived in Gabon to
help coordinate the international response to an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in
the Ogooue-Ivindo Province in the north-eastern part of the country.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Laboratory testing carried out at the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de
Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon indicates that the cause of the haemorrhagic fever outbreak
is the Ebola virus. For Gabon, this is the fourth Ebola outbreak since 1994. All outbreaks
have been in the central and northeastern regions of the country.</span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 12 December 2001, WHO has received reports of 10 deaths from haemorrhagic fever
among a total of 12 suspected cases.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Gabon Ministry of Health has established a national task force for managing the
response to the epidemic. WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health and this Task Force in
disease containment by:</span></p>
<p>
<span>coordinating the international response to the outbreak,</span></p>
<p>
<span>implementing disease control measures, such as barrier nursing procedures,</span></p>
<p>
<span>finding cases, tracing contacts and monitoring them, and</span></p>
<p>
<span>supplying protective equipment.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Dr Ray Arthur, an expert virologist, and a team of three colleagues from WHO
headquarters in Geneva, Dr Adamou Yada from the WHO African Regional Office, together with
Dr Herve Zeller from Institute Pasteur in Paris, France, have arrived in Gabon. Other
partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are expected to arrive soon in
Gabon.</span></p>
<p>
<span>"WHO and its partners will work with the Gabonese authorities to contain the
disease and to prevent any potential spread in local communities. It is very important
that there is an effective and coordinated international response to this outbreak,"
said Dr Mike Ryan, Coordinator of Global Alert and Response at WHO headquarters.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Ebola haemorrhagic fever is one of the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind,
causing death in 50-90% of cases. The Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with
the blood or body fluids of infected persons. The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976
in the western equatorial province of Sudan and in the nearby region of Yambuku, northern
Democratic Republic of the Congo, (then Zaire.)</span></p>
<p>
<span>Gabon's first verified Ebola outbreak occurred in December 1994 in gold mining
encampments. Investigators studying the outbreak were told of unexplained deaths of great
apes, gorillas and chimpanzees, but no dead animals were found. The outbreak ended six
weeks later.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Two other Ebola epidemics were confirmed in the spring and fall of 1996. In early
February, about 40 km south (seven hours by boat) from the 1994 outbreak, 13 people became
ill after butchering a dead chimpanzee they had found. In October of that year, another
Ebola epidemic was confirmed in the same general region.</span></p>
