<h1 class="headline">2000 - Anthrax in Ethiopia</h1>
<p>
<span><b>20 July 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO has received reports of clusters of cases of suspected anthrax in the Afar region
of Ethiopia. This area is inhabited by pastoralists who depend on livestock and cases of
anthrax are known to occur. Reports from organizations (e.g. United Nations Development
Programme, Médecins Sans Frontières) working in the area indicate clusters of cases and
increased numbers of cases of a clinical syndrome consistent with anthrax. No systematic
epidemiological investigation has been carried out thus far. WHO, in collaboration with
MSF/Epicentre and the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia, have planned to carry out an
investigation in the region in order to confirm the diagnosis, assess the true extent and
impact of the disease and plan and implement control measures.</span></p>
