<p>
<span>As of 1 January, 2002, 32 confirmed cases (15 laboratory
and 17 epidemiologically linked) have been reported; 20 cases have been detected in Gabon
and 12 in the neighbouring villages of the Republic of Congo (see map below). Among the 32
confirmed cases, there have been 23 deaths, 17 in Gabon and 6 in the Republic of Congo. An
additional 7 suspected cases in Gabon and 2 suspected cases in the Republic of Congo are
under investigation.Â </span></p>
<p>
<span>All contacts (having direct or suspected contact with the
blood or other body fluids of a case) are being closely monitored for signs or symptoms of
Ebola haemorrhagic fever for 21 days. As of 1 January, 2002, 191 contacts are under active
follow up; 96 contacts are being followed up in Gabon and 95 in the Republic of Congo. We

Ministries of Health on outbreak control interventions.</span></p>
