<h1 class="headline">1998 - Cholera in the Great Lakes Region</h1>
<p>
<span><b>22 October 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Since May 1998, Rwanda has been been suffering from a cholera
outbreak with a total of 2900 cases and 55 deaths, most of which were reported in
  September. All these cases have been in Cyangugu prefecture, but there is great concern
  about further spread to other areas of the country.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO is providing cholera kits to Kigali, Rwanda and with other international
organizations is working closely with the Ministry of Health on prevention and control
  measures.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Cholera has also badly affected the eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Although exact figures are not available, the situation in the Shabunda area of Sud-Kivu
  remains grave. The current deteriorating security situation in the area has affected
  control activities and the transport of supplies to treatment centres.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Great Lakes Region was ravaged by a dramatic cholera epidemic in 1994-1995 during
the massive displacement of refugees provoked by the civil war in Rwanda.</span></p>
