<h1 class="headline">2001 - Isolation of influenza A(H5N1) virus in poultry in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China</h1>
<p>
<span><b>18 May 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>There has been an increase in the number of deaths of
poultry from influenza A(H5N1) virus in <br/>
additional retail live-bird poultry markets (<a href="/csr/don/2001_05_17/en">see previous report</a>)
in Hong Kong SAR.</span></p>
<p>
<span>As a result, the Government of Hong Kong SAR has announced
that all wholesale and retail markets <br/>
selling chickens will be closed and the birds will be destroyed.  Retail outlets for
live chickens will <br/>
remain closed for 4 weeks. Farms with live chickens ready for slaughter will be
depopulated within the next <br/>
two weeks.  Importation of chickens from the Mainland has been stopped.</span></p>
<p>
<span>No human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus have been
detected.  The strains isolated from the birds <br/>
differ genetically from the H5N1 virus which caused human disease in 1997.  There is
no cause for <br/>
public health concern.</span></p>
