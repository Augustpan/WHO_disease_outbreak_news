<h1 class="headline">1998 - Cholera in West Africa</h1>
<p>
<span><b>14 October 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>There has been a recrudescence of cholera in the West Africa region
since September 1998. Some countries in the region have been reporting cases of cholera
  since the beginning of the year. As from September, however, there has been a considerable
  increase in the number of countries reporting from the region and in the number of cases.
    Eleven countries are currently reporting cases of cholera with, for the time being,
  a relatively acceptable case fatality rate. The ministries of health of the countries
  affected are taking steps to ensure adequate case management and prevent further spread.
  These measures have been quite successful so far. WHO is concerned about the potential
  deterioration of the situation in the region and therefore strongly recommends the
  strengthening of epidemic preparedness and response activities for the countries in West
  Africa.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The region was ravaged by a dramatic cholera epidemic in 1994-95. In 1995, West Africa
represented 64% of all cholera cases and 67% of all cholera deaths reported in Africa.</span></p>
