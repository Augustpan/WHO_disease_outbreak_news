<h1 class="headline">Poliomyelitis in Somalia</h1>
<p>
<span><b>24 March 2006</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Two new cases of poliomyelitis have been reported from two new regions: Lower Juba, southern Somalia and Mudug region, northeastern Somalia. These regions, with security-related restrictions, present a risk to neighbouring countries.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The cases also threaten the progress made in Mogadishu, formerly the epicentre of the outbreak which has affected a total of 199 children to date, but which appears to be on the decline in the city.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A nation-wide polio vaccination campaign is to be launched on 26 March and aims to vaccine 1.4 million children in an effort to halt further spread of the virus and protect the gains made in Mogadishu.</span></p>
