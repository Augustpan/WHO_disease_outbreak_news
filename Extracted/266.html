<p>
<span><b>03 February 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health has informed WHO of 5 laboratory confirmed cases of cholera
identified in Beira City, Sofala Province. The poor sanitary conditions in Beira had
  deteriorated following the storm which affected the central region of the country in
  January. As Beira is a port city with direct land communication to neighbouring countries,
  (the "Beira corridor"), the Ministry of Health and WHO advise those countries to
  strengthen their epidemiological surveillance for early detection of cases and reinforce
  their preparedness activities.</span></p>
