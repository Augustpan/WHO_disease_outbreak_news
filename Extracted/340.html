<h1 class="headline">1999 - Hendra-like virus (Nipah virus) in Malaysia - Update</h1>
<p>
<span><b>15 April 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>While the exact number of encephalitis cases and deaths in
Malaysia continues to be <a name="QuickMark"></a>tabulated, it is now apparent that the
  number of cases is no longer increasing, showing that the epidemic is under control. Both
  Japanese encephalitis virus and a Hendra-like virus (now being designated as Nipah virus)
  infections have been reported; however, Nipah virus appears to be the predominant
  pathogen. Cases have almost exclusively occurred in persons in close contact with pigs,
  especially those working is areas where there is disease in pigs. Pig culling in affected
  areas is ongoing to control Nipah virus transmission.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Multiple epidemiological studies both in animals and humans are
continuing. These include studies to determine the animal species infected by Nipah and to
  identify the natural reservoir of the virus. Among the studies in humans, emphasis is on
  the identification of the specific risk factors for infection. Investigators from the
  United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from other countries,
  including Australia and Japan, are working with the Malaysian government to conduct these
  studies.</span></p>
