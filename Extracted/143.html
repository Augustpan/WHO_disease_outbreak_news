<h1 class="headline">1997 - Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus</h1>
<p>
<span><b>19 June 1997</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The recently publicised finding of a strain of Staphylococcus aureus showing resistance (or
reduced susceptibility) to vancomycin has caused considerable concern, especially since the
low level of the resistance means that such strains may be missed in routine laboratory
antimicrobial susceptibility tests.  Dr Keiichi Hiramatsu of Juntendo University, Tokyo,
Japan, who described the characteristics of the vancomycin-resistant strain, has provided a
summary and a provisional method for detection available on EMC's web site for
Antimicrobial Resistance.  An account of his findings will be published in <i>Journal of
Antimicrobial Chemotherapy</i> in July 1997.</span></p>
