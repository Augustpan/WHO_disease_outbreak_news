<p>
<span><b>Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus</b><br/><br/>

According to FluNet reporting from the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN), 3548 detections of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus were reported from 13 countries in week 30. The majority of detections were reported by China, Hong Kong SAR (25%, 1788 detections), followed by Australia (21%, 834 detections) and Italy (16%, 600 detections). Among the 13 countries, on average, the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus accounted for 71% of all influenza virus detections (66% in northern hemisphere and 89% in southern hemisphere). The highest rate of detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus was reported by Greece (99%; 147 out of 149 detections), Chile (98%; 160 out of 163), the Republic of Korea (98%; 258 out of 263), Italy (97%; 584 out of 600), and Australia (89%; 745 out of 834).<br/><br/>

All pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses analyzed to date are antigenically and genetically similar.  
<br/><br/>
<b>Antiviral resistance pandemic (H1N1) virus</b><br/><br/>
 
A total of six oseltamivir resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses have now been detected from Denmark, Hong Kong SAR, Japan and Canada. Of these three were from patients in Japan. All six patients had received oseltamivir with the exception of one and have recovered well. All resistant viruses had the characteristic mutation at position 274/275 associated with resistance.
