<p>
<span><b>05 September 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 4 September, WHO has reported a total of 3557 cases,
including 113 deaths, with a case-fatality rate of 3.2% in the south-western part of the
country.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Please note that the increase in the total number of cases
(1099) <a href="/csr/don/2001_08_22/en">from the last report on 21 August</a> does
not necessarily indicate that the increase occurred during this two-week period. Rather,
it is the result of late reporting of data.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health, with the assistance of WHO and
Médecins sans Frontières, is continuing its surveillance efforts.</span></p>
<p>
<span>There is an ongoing outbreak of cholera across Chad's
border, in the northern part of Cameroon.  The Ministry of Health of Cameroon has
reported a total number of 158 cases, including 3 deaths.</span></p>
