<p>
<span><b>10 February 2005</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 9 February, WHO has received reports of 178 hospitalized cases of dengue infection and 16 deaths (case fatality ratio, 9%). More than 70% of the 178 cases had clinical features compatible with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and the remaining cases were diagnosed as suspected dengue fever (DF) using WHO standard case definitions. Districts reporting DF/DHF cases are Baucau, Dili, Liquica, Maliana and Manatuto with the majority of cases reported from Dili <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_02_03/en/">(see previous report)</a>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO has been providing technical support and on site training on case management for DHF to doctors and nurses in the National Hospital, Dili, and organized a seminar in which 67 doctors and nurses from all hospitals of Timor-Leste took part. With this assistance from WHO and from the staff of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Case Management of Dengue/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever, Thailand, Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, the case fatality rate has been decreasing in the National Hospital.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO has also assisted the Ministry of Health with epidemiological data to identify target areas for spraying operations; organized training of supervisors and sprayers in Dili; and provided personal protection equipment for sprayers. Additional insecticides and larvicides are expected to reach Dili next week.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health, with the help of WHO, is also developing health promotion strategies to sensitize the population about the disease and prevention.</span></p>
