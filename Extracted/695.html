    February 2002, the Gabonese Ministry of Health reported 49 confirmed cases, (19 by
    laboratory testing, 30 epidemiologically linked), including 42 deaths.  This
    increase in confirmed cases largely results from a reclassification of suspect cases
    following the availability of laboratory results.  <p>As of 1 February 2002, 20 confirmed cases, including 12 deaths have been reported
    in villages in the Republic of the Congo, close to the border between the two countries.
