<p>
<span>During the week of 28 March-3 April 2005, the Ministry of Health, Senegal reported 3475 cases including 54 deaths (case fatality rate, 1.5%) in the Diourbel region. Of these cases, 1733 cases, including 16 deaths were reported in the city of Touba. The increase in the number of cases is associated with the pilgrimage, "le Magal de Touba" which took place in the past week, drawing thousands of people to this region <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_03_31/en/">(see previous report)</a>. The outbreak appears to be spreading to other regions throughout the country.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO is providing technical support to the Ministry of Health, including intensification of surveillance, case management and health promotion activities. Neighbouring countries should also intensify their disease surveillance as well as their prevention and preparedness activities.</span></p>
