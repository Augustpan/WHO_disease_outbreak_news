<span>From 4 January to 28 March the Ministry of Health of Chad reported 1531  suspected cases of meningococcal disease including 151  deaths (case-fatality rate:10%). So far, seven districts have crossed the epidemic threshold (Bébidja, Bédjondo, Béré, Doba, Dono-Manga, Goundi and Laï) while three others crossed the alert threshold (Bénoye, Laokassi and Sarh).</span></p>
<p>
<span>Sixty seven specimens of cerebral spinal fluid have been found positive for <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> serogroup A by latex test while 14  specimens were found positive for <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> serogroup W135, by latex, and culture. This indicates that some areas are experiencing mixed epidemics (Dono-Manga), while others are being predominantly affected by either serogroup A (Doba, Bébidja district ) or serogroup W135 (Goundi district).</span></p>

<span>The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has provided 157,000 doses of trivalent ACW vaccine for a mass vaccination campaign in affected areas of Dono-Manga and Goundi as well as 282,000 doses of bivalent vaccine for mass vaccination in Doba and Bebidja. Vaccines are being provided with the  support of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).
