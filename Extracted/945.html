<h1 class="headline">Yellow fever in Burkina Faso - update</h1>
<p>
<span><b>1 June 2004</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 1 June 2004, the Ministry of Health, Burkina Faso has reported no new cases of yellow fever in Bobo-Dioulasso district (<a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_05_11/en/">see previous report</a>).</span></p>
<p>
<span>However, there is a high risk of a major urban outbreak of yellow fever in Bobo-Dioulasso in the immediate future. The rainy season is just beginning and the vector for yellow fever in an urban setting, <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, is already present in the district. Bobo-Dioulasso, with a population of 740 192, is densely populated and vaccination coverage against yellow fever is low. The district is also a busy crossroads for population movements across West Africa.</span></p>
<p>
<span>For these reasons, WHO strongly recommends a mass vaccination campaign in Bobo-Dioulasso as soon as possible.</span></p>
