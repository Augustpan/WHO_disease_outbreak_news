<p>
<span><b>18 October 2002</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 17 October, the Ministry of Health has confirmed 18 cases and 2 deaths
of yellow fever. The outbreak has affected Touba, Mbacké and<b> </b>Bambey<b>
</b>départements, Diourbel region and Gossas département, Fatick region
(<a href="/csr/don/2002_10_11/en">see previous report</a>).
Laboratory confirmation was made by the WHO Collaborating Centre 
at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar.  Fifteen of the cases were reported from 
Touba. </span></p>
<p>
<span>A mass immunization campaign began on 1 October and a total of 800,000 people
have been vaccinated in the following 4 health districts: Touba, Diourbel, 
Bambey, and Mbacké . An assessment by WHO indicates that the campaigns are 
proceeding well, but additional vaccine is urgently needed to complete the 
immunization program. </span></p>
<p>
<span>A second campaign for spraying insecticide in the city of Touba was conducted
by the National Service of Hygiene between 15-17 October. Entomological studies 
in Touba found high indices of <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, the mosquito responsible 
for explosive epidemics of urban yellow fever. As a result, vector control 
activities will also include larviciding and health education programs for 
removing mosquito breeding sites.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Health units throughout the country have been notified to 
increase surveillance for yellow fever. The units have been instructed to report 
to the central level within 24 hours, all cases fitting a standard case 
definition. Particular emphasis is focused on strengthening surveillance and 
vector control in Dakar. Teams with staff from the Ministry of Health, Institut 
Pasteur-Dakar, and WHO are conducting surveillance and case investigation 
activities. Samples from over 150 suspect cases have been sent to laboratories 
for testing.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO is assisting the Ministry of Health in the areas of surveillance,
immunization and coordination of the response to the outbreak. WHO has also 
contacted potential donors for assistance with purchasing vaccine.</span></p>
