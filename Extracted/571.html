<h1 class="headline">2001 - Meningococcal disease, serogroup W135</h1>
<p>
<span><b>27 April 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>During 2000, there was an international outbreak of
meningococcal disease caused by an unusual serogroup: W135</span></p>
<p>
<span>During 2001 the following countries have reported cases of
W135 meningococcal disease, associated with international travel or contact with
travellers to Saudi Arabia, to WHO:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Burkina Faso: 4 cases have been reported.  <i>N.
meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>Central African Republic</strong>: 3 cases (Haj
pilgrims) have been reported. <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory
confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>France</b>: 2 cases (close contacts with Haj pilgrims)
and no deaths have been reported. <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been
laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Norway: 4 cases (2 contacts with Haj pilgrims) and no
deaths have been reported. <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory
confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Saudi Arabia</b>: 109 cases (predominantly Haj pilgrims
from outside Saudi Arabia) including 35 deaths reported between 9 February and 22 March
2001. <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed in more than
half of the cases.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Singapore: 4 cases (3 close contacts with Haj pilgrims,
1 history of travel to Saudi Arabia) and no deaths have been reported. Two of the cases
occurred in January 2001, before the main period of pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. <i>N.
meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</b>:
28 laboratory confirmed cases including 7 deaths have been reported. Out of these cases, 8
were pilgrims returning from the Haj, 9 were close contacts of the latter, and data are
outstanding on the remaining cases. 2 cases occurred in January prior to the main
pilgrimage period. <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Meningococcal disease. As with all types of
meningococcal disease, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. The symptoms of group
W135 meningococcal disease are the same as for other groups of the disease: sudden onset
of intense headache, high fever, nausea, and vomiting, photophobia and stiff neck. The
most severe clinical form of the disease, meningococcal septicaemia can be presented by
abrupt onset, high fever, petechial rash or purpura.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO recommends that chemoprophylaxis be given to close
contacts of the cases, such as persons sleeping in the same dwelling. In most countries
rifampicin is recommended.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In preparation for the Umrah and the Haj seasons for next
year, the Ministry of Health of the Government of Saudi Arabia has notified the Ministries
of Health of all countries from which pilgrims arrive, that the vaccination against
meningococcal meningitis with the quadrivalent vaccine (serogroups A,C, Y and W135) has
been added to the health requirements for arrivals coming to the Umrah and Haj.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO encourages national reference laboratories to closely
monitor meningococcal disease.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In order to fully identify and follow the epidemiological
spread of the W135 strain, WHO encourages countries to send specimens to WHO Collaborating
Centres for Meningococcal Infections. The Centres are:</span></p>
