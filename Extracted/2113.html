<p>
<span>Cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to occur in Guinea. As of May 23, 2014, 8 new cases and 3 new deaths were reported from one newly affected district, Telimele (3 cases and 0 deaths) and two existing affected areas, Gueckedou (2 cases and 0 deaths) and Macenta (3 cases and 3 deaths).</span></p>
<p>
<span>Since the beginning of the outbreak, the cumulative total number of clinical cases of EVD is 258, including 174 deaths. The classification of these cases and deaths is as follows: confirmed (146 cases and 95 deaths); probable (67 cases and 57 deaths) and suspected (67 cases and 57 deaths). The geographical distribution of the clinical cases of EVD is as follows: Conakry (50 cases, including 25 deaths), Gueckedou (170/121), Macenta (22/17), Kissidougou (8/6), Dabola (4/4), Djinguiraye (1/1) and Telimele (3/0).

<p>
<span>The number of cases remains subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities. </span></p>

<span>In response to the new cluster of cases and deaths in Guinea, WHO has redeployed experts to the affected areas to support the EVD investigation; active case search and contact follow-up; establishment of isolation facilities in Telimele; case management and infection prevention and control. A team of social mobilization experts trained by WHO has also been redeployed to support public health awareness with an emphasis on approaches to addressing community resistance from some villages.</span></p>
