<p>
<span>As of 27 December, 29 confirmed cases (12 laboratory and 17
epidemiologically linked), including 20 deaths, have been reported.  An additional 8
suspected cases are under investigation in Gabon. All contacts (having direct or suspected
contact with the blood or other body fluids of a case) are being closely monitored for
signs or symptoms of Ebola haemorrhagic fever for 21 days. Currently, 206 contacts are
under active follow up. We anticipate one or more cases may develop among these contacts.</span></p>

<span>Of the 29 cases, 17 were detected in Gabon and 12 in the
neighbouring villages of the Republic of the Congo. As of 27 December, 91
contacts are being followed up in Gabon and 115 in the Republic of the Congo. The
international team is operational on both sides of the border and is working closely in
