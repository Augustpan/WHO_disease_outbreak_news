<h1 class="headline">1996 - Cholera in Liberia</h1>
<p>
<span><b>26 April 1996</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO, together with several partner agencies, has succeeded in delivering fresh supplies
of emergency medicines  and equipment to the beleaguered Liberian capital of Monrovia, where
fighting has left at least 1,450 persons wounded.  Of particular concern is that under the chaotic
conditions, a recent outbreak of cholera in Monrovia could quickly spread.</span></p>
<p>
<span>On Monday, a WHO team confirmed the presence of cholera in the BTC district of Monrovia.
Forty-seven cases have also been reported at the IDP compound in Greystone. </span></p>
<p>
<span>A WHO consignment of emergency medicine was airlifted by helicopter from Freetown to
Monrovia. The WHO country representative in Liberia is working closely with the Ministry of
Health, partner UN agencies and three local nongovernmental organizations to distribute the new
supplies to hospitals and health centres in Monrovia and re-organize emergency services.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO is also working to limit the spread of cholera and other infectious diseases in the city due
to the hazardous water and sanitation conditions, and to strengthen locally available technical
capacities to respond to epidemics.  </span></p>
<p>
<span>Cholera was also reported from the following countries in the past week: Mali, Niger, Togo and
Zaire.</span></p>
