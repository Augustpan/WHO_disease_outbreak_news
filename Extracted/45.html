<p>
<span><b>14 August 1996</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has
announced a steady upward trend in cholera figures in the
city of Monrovia and its environs since April 1996.  This
increase was initially in areas of inadequate sanitation and
water supply but has recently been apparent across the
city changing an endemic situation to a cholera epidemic.
Several control measures have been instituted, such as
the establishment of five referral health facilities  and an
ambulance system.  The Ministry of Health and Social
Welfare has also intensified health information and
education in Monrovia and its environs. </span></p>
