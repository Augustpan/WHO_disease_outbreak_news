<p>
<span><b>09 May 1997</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>A total of  4437 cholera cases with 146 deaths have been reported since the end of
November 1997  to 7 May 1997 although the real number of cases is believed to be higher
because of the difficulty of data collection.  Weekly reports have been made by NGOs
working in the country as well as by the local authorities where available.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A total of over 2 000 cases with 74 deaths has been recorded in the epidemic in  Mogadishu
but it appears that it has  now passed its peak, although high levels are still being  reported. 
Intensified efforts are still necessary to guarantee sufficient supplies to all NGOs involved
and continued vigilance is needed, especially in those areas not yet affected by this epidemic.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO is supporting the NGO's and local authorities by providing technical support and
supplies.</span></p>
