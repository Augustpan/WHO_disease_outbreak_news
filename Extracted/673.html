<td colspan="4" width="100%">During the first
    quarter of this year, Brazil's national health authorities have reported 317 
    787 cases of dengue fever including 57 deaths, with Rio de Janeiro State 
    being the most affected area with 41% of all cases registered. During 
    January and February 2002, in comparison with January and February 2001, an 
    increase in the number of cases has been observed in 14 of the 27 States and 
    the number of cases was 886% greater in Rio de Janeiro State during this 
    period in 2002. <p>As of 25 April 2002, 95 463 cases,
including 571 dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases and 31 deaths, were reported within
Rio de Janeiro Municipality alone. A dramatic decrease in disease activity was observed
during the month of April in the Municipality, with cases occurring between 1 and 25 April
representing 3% of cases reported since the beginning of the year.
       </p><p>This outbreak is associated with dengue serotype 3, which
has only been recently introduced in the population and explains the increased number of
DHF cases registered in 2002.
