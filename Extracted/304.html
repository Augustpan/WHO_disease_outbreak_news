The case occurred in a 19 year-old woman who lived in a mountainous, forested area near
the Albanian border. The diagnosis, suspected on clinical grounds, has been supported by
laboratory tests, which confirm hantavirus infection. The tests were performed by the WHO
Collaborating Centre for Arboviruses and Haemorrhagic Fevers in Thessaloniki, Greece.</span></p>
