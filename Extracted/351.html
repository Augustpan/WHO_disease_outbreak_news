<h1 class="headline">1999 - Janpanese Encephalitis and Hendra-like Viurs in Malaysia</h1>
<p>
<span><b>22 March 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>To date (19 March 1999), there are 133 reported cases of either confirmed or suspected
cases of Japanese Encephalitis in the outbreak which first started in Perak, and later in
  Negeri Sembilan. Of these, 54 persons have died. In this outbreak, out of 133 reported
  cases, 42 have been confirmed to have Japanese Encephalitis. Many cases may soon be
  confirmed as the laboratory results become available.<br/></span></p>
<p>
<span>In addition to Japanese Encephalitis, there is now
evidence of a new virus. This virus was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of 5 out of
  30 patients sent to Professor S K Lam and his team at the Department of Medical
  Microbiology, University of Malaya. Their finding was subsequently confirmed by the
  Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, USA. This virus is a member of the Paramyxovirus
  family. It is closely related to Hendra virus which was first isolated in Hendra, a suburb
  of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia. In the outbreak which occurred in 1994, race horses
  and 3 persons whose work involved close contact with horses were taken ill. 2 of the 3
  persons subsequently died, one died of severe respiratory infection and the other of
  encephalitis after a latent period of 13 months.</span></p>
