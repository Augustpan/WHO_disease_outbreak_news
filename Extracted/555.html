<h1 class="headline">2001 - Meningococcal disease, serogroup W135 - Update 2</h1>
<p>
<span><b>22 June 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>During 2001 the following countries have reported cases of W135 meningococcal disease
to WHO (<a href="/csr/don/2001_05_16/en">see previous report)</a> ; most cases are
associated with international travel or contact with travellers to Saudi Arabia:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Burkina Faso: <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed
in 4 cases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States.
Travel/contact history of cases is not yet known. <b></b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Following a joint mission of Institut Pasteur, Paris and Association pour la
Médecine Préventive (AMP) ) to investigate the epidemic meningitis situation, 10
additional cases of <i>N. meningitidis </i>W135 were laboratory confirmed.  The
samples were taken from documented cases between 10-24 April 2001 and the proportion of <i>N.
meningitidis</i> isolates belonging to the W135 serogroup was found to be 37% of the total
<i>N. meningitidis </i>isolates identified by PCR on collected specimens.  None of
the cases had any relationship with the 2001 Haj pilgrimage (travel or contact history).
  Among 4 strains that were cultured from the same period, 3 were W135:2a:P1-2,5 and
belong to the ET-37 complex.<b></b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Niger: A joint mission of Institut Pasteur, Paris and AMP investigated the epidemic
meningitis situation and identified 10 laboratory confirmed cases of <i>N. meningitidis </i>W135.
The samples were taken from documented cases between 10-16 April 2001 and the proportion
of <i>N. meningitidis</i> isolates belonging to the W135 serogroup was found to be 40% of
the total <i>N. meningitidis </i>isolates identified by PCR on collected specimens.  
None of the cases had any relationship with the 2001 Haj pilgrimage (travel or contact
history).<strong></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span>Central African Republic: 3 cases (Haj pilgrims) have been reported. <i>N.
meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 have been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Denmark: 2 cases (one case close contact with Haj pilgrims, the travel/contact
history of the second case is not yet known)have been reported. <i>N. meningitidis</i>
serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>France: 2 cases (close contacts with Haj pilgrims) have been reported. <i>N.
meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Norway: 4 cases (2 contacts with Haj pilgrims) have been reported. <i>N.
meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Saudi Arabia: 109 cases (predominantly Haj pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia)
including 35 deaths have been reported between 9 February and 22 March 2001. <i>N.
meningitidis</i> serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed in more than half of the
cases.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Singapore: 4 cases (3 close contacts with Haj pilgrims, 1 history of travel to
Saudi Arabia), including 1 death have been reported. Two of the cases occurred in January
2001, before the main period of pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. <i>N. meningitidis</i>
serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 41 cases (8 pilgrims
returning from the Haj, 19 cases of close contacts and data outstanding on the remaining
cases) including 11 deaths of laboratory confirmed invasive <i>N. meningitidis</i>
serogroup W135 have been reported.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Meningococcal disease. As with all types of meningococcal disease, early diagnosis
and treatment are essential. The symptoms of group W135 meningococcal disease are the same
as for other groups of the disease: sudden onset of intense headache, high fever, nausea,
and vomiting, photophobia and stiff neck. The most severe clinical form of the disease,
meningococcal septicaemia can be presented by abrupt onset, high fever, petechial rash or
purpura.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO recommends that chemoprophylaxis be given to close contacts of the cases, such as
persons sleeping in the same dwelling. In most countries rifampicin is recommended.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In preparation for the Umrah and the Haj seasons for next year, the Ministry of Health
of the Government of Saudi Arabia has notified the Ministries of Health of all countries
from which pilgrims arrive, that the vaccination against meningococcal meningitis with the
quadrivalent vaccine (serogroups A,C, Y and W135) has been added to the health
requirements for arrivals coming to the Umrah and Haj.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO encourages national reference laboratories to closely monitor meningococcal
disease.</span></p>
