<h1 class="headline">1998 - Cholera in Africa</h1>
<p>
<span><b>09 January 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Many countries in eastern and southern Africa are currently affected by severe
outbreaks of cholera. Despite control measures which are being undertaken, past experience
  suggests that the cholera epidemic will spread to other countries, accompanied by a very
  negative impact on public health and serious social and economic consequences.</span></p>
<p>
<span>National authorities in collaboration with WHO and other agencies are continuing to
implement and strengthen cholera prevention and control measures in the affected countries
  and countries at risk. The cholera situation in the region has triggered questions and
  interest regarding appropriate measures to prevent the international spread of cholera. </span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO advises that travel and trade restrictions have never proved to be effective in
controlling the international spread of cholera but that sound public health practices are
  the most effective approach.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO therefore recommends that:</span></p>
<p>
<span>countries should not use travel and trade restrictions, quarantine or frontier controls
in the efforts to prevent the spread of cholera; if there is a theoretical risk of cholera
  transmission through trade, agreement should be reached between exporting and importing
  countries on the most appropriate public health measures to prevent transmission. These
  could include measures to validate good practices at food processing plantstourism to
  cholera affected areas should not be restricted no country should require travellers to
  have been vaccinated against cholera (International Health Regulations) mass
  chemo-prophylaxis should not be used in efforts to control cholera</span></p>
