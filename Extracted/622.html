<p>
<span><b>11 October 2002</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health officially confirmed 15 cases and 2 deaths of yellow fever in
Mbacké and<b> </b>Bambey<b> </b>départements, Diourbel region. Laboratory confirmation
was made by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar. All cases
except one have been reported in the city of Touba. The other case was reported in Bambey,
70 km west of Touba.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A mass immunization campaign began on 1 October. A total of 322 000 people have been
vaccinated in 2 health districts, Mbacké and Touba. National vaccine stocks are not
sufficient to immunize the target population in Diourbel region and additional vaccine is
needed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In response to a request for international assistance from the Ministry of Health, WHO
staff from the West Africa sub-regional team, the Regional Office for Africa and
headquarters are in Senegal helping to contain the outbreak. The first members of the team
arrived in Senegal on 10 October. They are working with the Ministry on the management of
the vaccination campaign, including safety and monitoring for adverse events, enhancing
yellow fever surveillance in the country and the coordination of the program to control
the outbreak.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry has also requested additional vaccine and supplies. WHO and its partners
in the yellow fever sub-group of the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision
(ICG), Médecins sans Frontières (MSF), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies (IFRC), and UNICEF are working to meet this request. Additional funds
are urgently needed to complete this mass vaccination campaign.</span></p>
