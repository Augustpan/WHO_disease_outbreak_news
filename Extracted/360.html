<span><b>12 March 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The outbreak that started in Northern Darfur State in December 1998 has now
spread to 15 States, some of them reaching epidemic level. From the beginning of the
  epidemic (01.12.98) up to 9 March, 2 293 cases and 262 deaths have been reported by
  the Federal Ministry of Health. An appeal has been launched by the Ministry of Health in
  Khartoum, with support from the executive members of the International Coordinating
  Group,WHO, UNICEF, IFRC and MSF, for the provision of meningococcal vaccine. There is an
  urgent need for more vaccines, drugs and technical support to strengthen the surveillance
  systems and laboratory capacity. There is also a need for logistic support and to ensure
  appropriate training of health staff at local levels.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The government has already provided a significant proportion of the necessary supplies,
and is appealing to its partners to complete the support and resources needed to limit the
  impact of the outbreak.  For futher information from WHO, please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ae9fbfee8f3e0fbfefff2f8daedf2f5b4e9f9f3b4fffd"><template class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b9cad8ddcbd0c3d8dddcd1dbf9ced1d697cadad097dcde">[email protected]</template></a>; <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bacdd2d5c9cfdefac9cfdedbd4dfce94d4dfce"><template class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="03746b6c70766743707667626d66772d6d6677">[email protected]</template></a>; or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ff8c9e918b9e929e8d969e92bf889790d19c97"><template class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8ffceee1fbeee2eefde6eee2cff8e7e0a1ece7">[email protected]</template></a>.</span></p>
