<p>
<span><b>27 July 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Since 18 June a number of sporadic suspect cases of plague have occurred in Nsanje
district, Southern Region. Up to 21 July, 74 suspect cases had been reported from a total
of 22 villages. Six villages along the Mozambican border were the most affected reporting
around 3 to 4 suspect cases each. Some of the other villages reported only one suspect
case each. The treatment of patients is under way as well as environmental control
measures which include spraying and dusting of affected and surrounding housing areas,
health education on proper storage of foodstuffs and refuse disposal. The situation was
being handled effectively by the Ministry of Health but drug supplies have been depleted
and more may be needed. WHO has offered its assistance to the national health authorities.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The last outbreak of plague in Malawi was in 1997 when a total of 582 cases were
reported including cases in Nsanje, Chikwawa and Ntchisi Districts, all in Southern
Region. <b></b></span></p>
