<h1 class="headline">1998 - Cholera in Latin America and El Niño</h1>
<p>
<span><b>31 March 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Many countries in the Americas are experiencing unexpected outbreaks of cholera
associated with extreme weather conditions brought by the arrival of the El Niño
  phenomenon.</span></p>
<p>
<span>During 1998, the following countries have already reported cholera outbreaks: Bolivia
(La Paz, El Alto, Valles y Tropico de la Paz) 165 cases and 5 deaths; Honduras (La
  Mosquitia in Gracias a Dios Department ) 219 cases and 12 deaths; Ecuador (Loja Province)
  11 cases and 1 death; Peru (various departments) 2863 cases and 16 deaths; Nicaragua
  (border area with Honduras) 3 suspected cases. It is expected that other countries in the
  region will report increased cholera incidence in the coming months.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Preventive and control measures are being taken by the Ministries of Health of the
affected countries. However, as the epidemic enters its 8th year in the western hemisphere
  and with the added impact of El Niño, cholera will continue to challenge governments and
  health agencies; additional international resources for emergency preparedness and control
  measures will be needed this year. WHO/PAHO are working closely with countries in the
  region to reactivate cholera preparedness and response plans.</span></p>
