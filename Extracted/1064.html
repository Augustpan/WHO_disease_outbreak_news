<h1 class="headline">Cholera in West Africa</h1>
<p>
<span><b> 26 August 2005</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The current wave of cholera outbreaks started several weeks ago in West Africa. So far, 31 259 cases and 517 deaths have been reported in eight countries (<a href="#map">see map below</a>). Seasonal factors, such as the rainy season, along with population movements in the area contribute to this unusually high incidence of cholera.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO, with international and national health partners, is providing technical support to the ministries of health at the country and sub-regional level. WHO is working to strengthen surveillance activities. Supplies for case management and chlorination of water have also been dispatched to some of the countries.</span></p>
