Disease Outbreak Reported 
</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Seventeen cases of acute watery diarrhoeal syndrome have been notified in 2 hospitals in Basra, southern Iraq, since April 28. According to the initial laboratory analysis in Basra, cholera is highly probable. Further laboratory confirmation with serotyping is awaited.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO staff in the field have already set up a surveillance system. They are currently conducting a survey of diarrhoeal cases in other hospitals, and have established an outbreak committee that is implementing control measures using pre-positioned supplies.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Due to the current security situation and difficulties experienced in restoring safe water supplies to the population, a larger cholera epidemic is predicted.</span></p>
