<span><b>21 October 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>During August-September 1999, an outbreak of meningococcal disease was reported in
Yambala, a settlement difficult to access in the municipality of Cubal, province of
Benguela. <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> serogroup A was detected by latex test.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Due to the current security situation, an assessment team which visited the area in
mid-October was not able to examine patients or collect samples for laboratory diagnosis.
However, according to information sources considered to be reliable, clinical features
observed by witnesses were compatible with cerebrospinal meningitis. The majority of cases
occurred in the age group 18-25 years, with no sex distinction. Reports refer to 253 cases
with 147 deaths. It should be noted that 92% of the cases reported had no access to
municipal health.</span></p>
