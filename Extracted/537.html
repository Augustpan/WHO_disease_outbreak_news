<h1 class="headline">2001 - Yellow fever in Côte dÎvoire - Update 2</h1>
<p>
<span><b>12 September 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>A WHO assessment team has been working with the Ministry of
Health, UNICEF and other partners to implement measures to contain the urban outbreak of
yellow fever in Abidjan. The Ministry of Health is currently carrying out vaccination
campaigns using limited national stocks in the areas of Abidjan where cases have been
identified. A mass campaign for the entire
city of Abidjan is planned to begin on 17 September.  It is crucial that this
vaccination campaign take place as soon as possible to raise the level of immunity in the
city's population and so reduce the risk of spread of yellow fever.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO is strengthening an international team assisting the
Ministry of Health in this urgent campaign.  WHO epidemiologists, specialists in
vaccination campaigns and an entomologist will be working to ensure the efficacy of the
campaign.  In addition, partners from the Global
Outbreak Alert and Response Network will be joining the team.   </span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO has launched an urgent appeal for US $ 2.9
million to cover the cost of this mass campaign.  To date, US$ 600,000 has been
pledged by the French government, European Commission, WHO and UNICEF to cover the
operational costs of the campaign as well as vector control activities.  Further
funds will be required to purchase the vaccine from an international stockpile as soon as
possible.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO advises travellers to Côte d'Ivoire to be aware of the
risk of yellow fever and to ensure that they are vaccinated (this is a requirement of the <a href="http://policy.who.int/cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?infobase=Ihreg&amp;softpage=Browse_Frame_Pg42">International
