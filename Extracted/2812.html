<h3 class="section_head1">Public health response</h3>
<ul class="disc">
<li>On 22 January 2019, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) declared the outbreak an emergency. </li>
<li>Multi-sectoral One Health national rapid response teams have been deployed to Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Plateau, and Bauchi to support field investigation and response activities.</li>
<li>Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all states following alert communication and a press release from NCDC.</li>
<li>Treatment of Lassa fever cases is also ongoing at designated treatment centres across the country. </li>
<li>Risk communication and community engagement activities continue in the states. National awareness was improved through the recently concluded international Lassa fever conference which took place from 16 through 17 January 2019.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="section_head1">WHO risk assessment</h3>
<p>
<span>Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Although Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly. </span></p>
<p>
<span>With twelve confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures.</span></p>
<h3 class="section_head1">WHO advice</h3>
<p>
<span>Prevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. WHO continues to advice all countries in the Lassa fever belt on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the currently available information.</span></p>
