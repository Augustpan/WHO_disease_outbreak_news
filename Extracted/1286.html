<p>
<span><b>1 March 2006</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>A WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom has verified H5N1 avian influenza as the cause of death in a 39-year-old Iraqi man,<a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_02_17/en/"> previously announced </a> by the Ministry of Health.</span></p>
<p>
<span>This brings the number of laboratory-confirmed cases in Iraq, listed in the WHO cumulative table, to 2. Both cases were fatal.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Virus has been isolated from the samples and genetic sequencing is presently under way.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The UK laboratory is also conducting tests on samples taken from additional cases under investigation from the northern province of Sulaimaniyah and the southern provinces of Basra and Missan.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Diagnostic testing was initially delayed by problems encountered in the shipment of samples from Iraq. Most of these problems have now been solved.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To date, poultry outbreaks of H5 avian influenza have been confirmed in Sulaimaniyah and Missan provinces. Both outbreaks are thought to have begun in mid-January.</span></p>
