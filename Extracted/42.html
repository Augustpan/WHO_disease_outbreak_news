<p>
<span><b>28 August 1996</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The outbreak of enterohaemorrhagic <cite>Escherichia coli</cite> (EHEC) infection in
Sakai City has affected a total of 6 309 schoolchildren and 92 school staff members from
  62 municipal elementary schools. Another 160 cases have been reported, mainly among family
  members of infected schoolchildren. No new cases have been reported since 8 August. The
  number of hospitalized patients peaked at 534 on 18 July and had decreased to 31 by 26
  August. The number of patients diagnosed with haemolytic uraemic syndrome peaked at 101
  cases on 24 July. Two of them, a 10-year-old girl and a 12-year-old girl, had died by 26
  August. <cite>E.coli</cite> serotype O157:H7 was commonly detected in patients' stool
  samples.</span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 26 August 1996, a total of 9 578 cases of <i>E.coli</i> serotype O157:H7 had been
reported in Japan, resulting in 11 deaths. Although most of the cases are believed to be
  food borne, the contaminated food has not been identified with certainty except in a few
  isolated cases. Analysis of DNA patterns of the isolates from various sources suggests a
  heterogenous origin of contamination.</span></p>
