<h1 class="headline">2001 - Unverified rumours of viral haemorrhagic fever in Democratic Republic of Congo</h1>
<p>
<span><b>05 January 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The onset of the outbreak of Ebola in Gulu, Uganda  <a href="/csr/don/2001_01_03/en">(see previous report)</a> has heightened awareness of viral
haemorrhagic fevers in the region. As a result, WHO has been investigating periodic
rumours of similar outbreaks in the surrounding countries. In Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), WHO has investigated rumours in Dungu, Bengadi, Isiro, Buta, Nyankunde and Bunia,
and samples have been negative for Ebola.</span></p>
<p>
<span>As part of these ongoing operations, WHO is currently
investigating unverified reports of  2 additional cases for which few clinical
details have been reported, in Bunia, DRC. The WHO Outbreak Response Team in Gulu has been
in contact with WHO Office, Goma,  Médecins sans Frontières (MSF), Goma and the WHO
sub-office in Bunia regarding these unverified rumours. A WHO surveillance officer at the
Bunia sub-office is investigating the reports. In addition, a team from MSF and WHO will
travel to Bunia early next week.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Previously 3 suspected cases were reported in Bunia, one in
early August, one in mid-November and a third in late-November. WHO investigations
demonstrated that these rumours were unfounded.</span></p>
