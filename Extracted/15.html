<h1 class="headline">1996 - Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Gabon (new outbreak) - Update 5</h1>
<p>
<span><b>19 November 1996</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>A source from the Ministry of Health in Gabon
has notified WHO that the physician who flew to South
Africa for treatment on 27 October had been in direct
contact with one of two patients previously identified during
the Boou√© outbeak.  These two patients had travelled to
Libreville for health care.  The Ministry of Health is now
looking for additional contacts in Libreville.  As the
maximum incubation period has elapsed since the infected
physician left the country and no new cases have been
seen, it is unlikely that Ebola virus transmission is still
going on in the capital.   If no new cases are detected, the
physician who left Libreville on 27 October will be the last
in the outbreak which then could be declared over on 11
December.</span></p>
