<p align="left"><b>UGANDA EBOLA OUTBREAK

<p align="left">The Uganda Ebola outbreak, which was first
    reported in October 2000, is officially over. The last person to be infected by the virus
    recovered 42 days ago, twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola to develop.</p><p>
</p><p align="justify">The international response, in support of
    the Government of Uganda helped to break the cycle of transmission of the virus which
    killed 224 people in Uganda, including health workers and Dr. Matthew Lukwiya, who first
    identified the outbreak.</p>
<p align="justify">More than 20 international NGOs and
    government agencies (<a href="#Annex">see list below</a>) from WHO's Global Outbreak
    Alert and Response Network worked together to combat the outbreak. In particular, the
    Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, US (CDC), Epicentre, Health Canada, Italian
    Cooperation, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF), the Red Cross and UNICEF, together with
    institutions in Belgium, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom worked closely with the
    doctors, nurses and staff at Gulu Hospital and Lacor Hospital, and Ugandan government
    officials.</p>
<p align="justify">"The successful operation in Uganda
    emphasized what can be achieved when we identify epidemic threats rapidly and act together
    swiftly. Today we recognize the efforts of the people of Uganda, and the contributions and
    achievements of our partners." says David Heymann, Executive Director of WHO's
    Communicable Diseases. "Epidemic prone diseases are harmful to communities and ignore
    national borders. We need to recognize them as threats to global health security and
    coordinate effective international solutions."</p>
<p align="justify">In this regard, WHO is working to mobilize
    the international community to strengthen epidemic alert and response and raise awareness
    of the global threat of infectious diseases. Global health security will be a top agenda
    item at this year's World Health Assembly.</p>
<p align="justify">First reports from Gulu District of an
    unusual severe febrile illness reached the Ugandan Ministry of Health in Kampala on 8
    October 2000. Even before the disease was formally identified as Ebola, the Government of
    Uganda facilitated rapid access to the outbreak area and partners in WHO's Global
    Outbreak Alert and Response Network responded with technical experts, protective equipment
    and logistics support for the Outbreak Response.</p>
<p>Initial laboratory confirmation was carried out by the
    National Institute of Virology in South Africa. A field laboratory was maintained at Lacor
    Hospital by CDC throughout the outbreak. This innovative measure guaranteed essential
    laboratory services for diagnostic tests to confirm or refute Ebola infection, and for
    packaging and transport of clinical samples requiring additional investigations.</p>
<p align="justify">Direct financial support to the Ebola
    Appeal was provided by Canada, ECHO, the European Commission, Ireland, Norway and Japan to
    supplement contingency funding provided by Germany and the Netherlands. In addition, many
    donors and agencies provided assistance directly to Uganda.</p>
<p align="justify">The mobilization of the local community in
    Gulu played a pivotal role in controlling the Ebola outbreak and is central to a new
    early-warning surveillance system for epidemic-prone diseases. Following the Ebola
    Outbreak partners in WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and
    Uganda's Ministry of Health are implementing a community-based disease surveillance
    system that will significantly improve people's lives and represents a potential model for
    future development of community-based surveillance systems.</p>
<p align="justify">Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) is one of
    the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind, causing death in 50-90% of all
    clinically ill cases. The virus was first identified in a western equatorial province of
    Sudan and in a nearby region of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1976 after
    significant epidemics in Yambuku, northern Zaire, and Nzara, southern Sudan.</p>
<p align="justify">Including the most recent outbreak, about
    1500 cases with over 1000 deaths have been documented since the virus was discovered.</p>
