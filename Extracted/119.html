<p>
<span><b>19 November 1997</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>The weekly number of cases of cholera continues to increase bringing the total to 1664 cases
and 62 deaths (case fatality rate 3.7%) reported since the second week of August up to 7
November.  These cases were reported from Maputo City as well as in other areas of
Maputo Province.  Forty-seven suspect cases (10 confirmed)  were  also registered in Gaza
Province during the week 7 to 13 November  where a team from the Ministry of Health and
WHO visited  on 13 November.  All cases were in the capital of the province, Xai-Xai City,
and 57% were from one quarter relying on drinking water from the Limpopo river.  A cholera
ward has been established at the provincial hospital and a special tent has been set up in the
most affected area to ensure early ORT of patients. </span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health, WHO and Médecins Sans Frontières have discussed the situation and
strategies to meet the continuing increase which is occuring in spite of control activities such
as health education and improvement of sanitation and water supply.  The poor condition of
sanitation and water supply in other cities is increasing the risk of spread to other provinces of
the country.  The circulating strain of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> is resistant to common antibiotics
available in the country and therapy therefore centres on initial administration of intravenous 
fluids initially followed by ORT.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health is appealing to MSF for staff and equipment to support  medical
assistance for cholera patients in Maputo City and Province and is requesting  WHO support
for material and funds for therapy and health education during the coming six months.</span></p>
