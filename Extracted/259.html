<p>
<span><b>20 February 1998</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 16 February, 282 cases with 10 deaths (case fatality rate 3.5%) have been
reported, mainly in Moroni (the capital city) and surrounding villages and Mb√©ni 40 km
  north of Moroni. <cite>Vibrio cholerae</cite> O1, El Tor has been confirmed by the
  national laboratory in Moroni and Institut Pasteur, Paris. Testing for antibiotic
  susceptibility showed the isolates to be sensitive to doxycycline and tetracycline and
  resistant to bactrim and choloramphenicol.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO has been involved with the national authorities in controlling the outbreak since
it was notified on 19 January. A national cholera committee has been established with
  personnel from the Ministry of Health, other UN agencies and NGOs meeting daily in the WHO
  office. Activities are directed at improving case management in the national hospital,
  training of health staff and education of the general public, ensuring safe water,
  supplies of oral rehydration salts, chlorine and other material. Mobile teams have been
  employed to provide health education, disseminate information and to disinfect and
  chlorinate water sources. Teams have visited affected areas to assess the situation and
  neighbouring islands to initiate outbreak preparedness. A plan for preparedness and
  control for the coming six months is currently being considered by the national
  authorities.</span></p>
