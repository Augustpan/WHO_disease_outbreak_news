<h1 class="headline">1996 - Yellow Fever in Benin</h1>
<p>
<span><b>02 October 1996</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>An outbreak of yellow fever has been reported in
the Department of Atakora in the north east region of the
country.  The area affected is Kerou Sous Préfecture
(population 44 329) where 48 cases and 37 deaths have
been recorded.   These cases occurred between July and
September 1996.  Urgent control measures were put into
place following a meeting with the Minister of Health:</span></p>
<p>
<span><ul>
<li>	 an immediate epidemiological investigation to be
	carried out in the areas affected;</li></ul></span></p>
<p>
<span><li>	strengthening of surveillance including declaration of
	all cases of haemorrhagic fever with jaundice</li></span></p>
<p>
<span><li>	immediate vaccination of the exposed population and
	informing the population to use impregnated mosquito
	nets;</li></span></p>
<p>
<span><li>	 informing countries with common borders of the
	situation.</li></span></p>
<p>
<span><li>	an entomological investigation into the density of the
	Aedes population in certain  urban areas  was also
	foreseen.</li></span></p>
<p>
<span></span></p>
<p>
<span>A team led by the Minister of Health accompanied by the
WHO Representative visited the area on 17 and 18
September to assess the situation.  A vaccination
campaign was started immediately with the  stock of
13000 vaccines already available provided by the French
<cite>Fonds d'Aide et d'Action culturelle</cite> and WHO.    Two
further donations of 50  000 doses of vaccine were made
by  the government of the Netherlands and the European
Union.   The health authorities plan to vaccinate   the
whole population of Kérou and surrounding areas
(population over 350,000) and therefore need over 200
000 further doses for this purpose.  An appeal has been
made for financial support.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Travellers are reminded that yellow fever vaccination is
obligatory for entry into the country.</span></p>
