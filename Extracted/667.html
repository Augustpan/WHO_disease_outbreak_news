<td width="100%"> A three-person team from the Congolese Ministry of Health and WHO that is
    currently investigating 6 suspected cases including 5 deaths of acute haemorrhagic fever
    syndrome in Mbomo district, Cuvette Ouest region (<a href="/csr/don/2002_06_12e/en">see previous
    report</a>), have traced 40 human contacts of the 6 suspected cases. No new cases have been reported
    since the last death on 6 June. The investigation has been hampered by the lack of
    community cooperation and increased emphasis will be placed on social mobilization
    activities. <p>The epidemiological
    pattern of this cluster and the clinical signs of the suspected cases were consistent with
    the <a href="/csr/don/2002_04_09/en">previous outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in
    the area</a>, but since no samples have been collected, there has been no laboratory
    confirmation. </p></td>
