<h1 class="headline">2001 - Legionellosis in Spain</h1>
<p>
<span><b>12 July 2001</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 11 July, the National Centre for Epidemiology, Spain,
has reported a total of 470 cases of suspected legionellosis in Murcia.
One-hundred-seventy-eight of these cases have been laboratory confirmed, and the first
case was hospitalized on 1 July. One patient, a 65-year-old male, has died. No cases have
been reported among tourists.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The majority of cases are residents in the northern
neighborhoods of the city. It is suspected that local cooling towers, several of which are
present in these neighborhoods, are the most likely source of infection, however other
possible sources are being investigated.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A detailed investigation by the health authorities and
environmental sampling are presently being conducted.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Legionellosis is a bacterial disease. Humans are infected
by inhaling small droplets or particles contaminated with Legionella bacteria. Control
measures focus on eliminating the source of the infectious particles. The infection is not
transmitted from person-to-person.</span></p>
