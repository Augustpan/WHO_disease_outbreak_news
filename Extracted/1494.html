<span><b>20 February 2008</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 20 February 2008, The Ministry of Health (MoH), Paraguay have notified the confirmation of 7 cases of jungle yellow fever from San Pedro Department. Another cluster with 4 clinically compatible cases occurred in the urban area of San Lorenzo municipality, 20 km from Asuncion. Final confirmation of these 4 cases is pending.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Ministry of Health has strengthened public health containment measures in the affected areas. Integrated control measures involving mass vaccination for people living in, or travelling to, the affected area; vector control; and heightened surveillance are underway to prevent serious public health consequences given the current low level of immunization among the people living in the affected area.</span></p>
<p>
<span>A PAHO team of experts including an epidemiologist, clinician/virologist, risk communicator, immunization advisers and emergency management experts was deployed to Paraguay on 15 February. A laboratory scientist from IEC Instituto Evandro Chagas (Brazil) will join the national public health laboratory shortly.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Yellow fever vaccines shortage has been addressed by mobilizing vaccines available in countries of the region. In addition, the MoH has requested 2 million doses of vaccine from the WHO ICG (International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision).</span></p>
