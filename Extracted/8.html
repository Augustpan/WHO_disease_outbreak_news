<span>WHO comment: This is to inform visitors of the full requirements for entry into the country; it
does not mean an endorsement by WHO of all measures stipulated.   Saudi Arabia is enforcing
these measures in accordance with International Health Regulations (1969) Part VIII, article 84
which states "Migrants, nomads, seasonal workers or persons taking part in periodic mass
congregations, and any ship, in particular small boats for international coastal traffice, aircraft,
train, road vehicle or other means of transport carrying them, may be subjected to additional
health measures conforming with the laws and regulations of each State concerned, and with any
agreement concluded between any such States." </span></p>
