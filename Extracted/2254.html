<span>On 12 November 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of Suriname notified PAHO/WHO of 4 additional cases of Zika virus infection. The cases were laboratory confirmed by the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA). Furthermore, one of two previously reported cases (see DON published on 11 November) was also re-confirmed by CARPHA.</span></p>
<h3 class="section_head1">WHO advice</h3>
<p>
<span>Given the increased transmission of Zika virus in the Region of the Americas, PAHO/WHO recommends that its Member States establish and maintain the capacity to detect and confirm cases of Zika virus infection, prepare their health services for a potential additional burden at all levels of health care, and implement an effective public communications strategy to reduce the mosquitoes that transmit this disease, particularly in areas where this vector is present. The complete set of recommendations is available in the latest Epidemiological Update (see related links).</span></p>
