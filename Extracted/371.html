<p>
<span><b>12 January 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>An outbreak of meningococcal meningitis has been reported in the Northern Darfur
region. The first cases were reported on 12 December 1998, and the total of 126 for
  December 1998 is 5 times higher than the number reported for the same month in 1997. Cases
  have continued to be reported at an increasing rate, reaching a total of 169 by 6 January.
  Over 20 deaths have been reported.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The organism has been identified as <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> serogroup A, and
tests indicate that it is sensitive to first-line antibiotics. Sudan lies in the so-called
  meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa. A large epidemic last occurred in 1988-1989, with
  over 40 000 cases and 7 500 deaths.</span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO is sending a team to assist with the assessment of the epidemiological situation
and needs. Other international partners, such as UNICEF, <i>Médecins sans frontières</i>
  and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, are also making
  plans to support control of the outbreak.</span></p>
