<p>
<span>On 20 April 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for Germany informed WHO that a previously reported case of Lassa fever in Germany has fully recovered and been discharged from hospital in Frankfurt. This secondary case was an employee of the funeral home tasked with handling the primary case’s corpse on 2 March (see DON posted 23 March).</span></p>
<p>
<span>The case had recovered by 6 April, when all the contacts completed their 21-day follow-up period, however his hospital discharge was delayed due to persistent viraemia. The patient was discharged after two consecutive negative test results by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Tests were performed on blood, urine, and pharyngeal swab samples at 24-hour intervals.

<h3 class="section_head1">WHO risk assessment</h3>
<p>

The risk of disease spread to non-endemic countries by travellers from Lassa fever endemic countries in the West Africa is very low.</span></p>
<h3 class="section_head1">WHO advice</h3>
