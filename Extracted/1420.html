<p>
<span>On 23 January 2007, the Ministry of Health in Chad confirmed one new polio case (type 3). It is the first polio case in Chad since December 2005. A two-year-old girl from N'Djamena had developed paralysis on 26 November 2006. Genetic sequencing of the isolated poliovirus indicates that it is related to poliovirus circulating in northern Nigeria.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In response to the confirmation of polio, the Ministry of Health conducted a nationwide mass immunization campaign on 25-28 January 2007, immunizing nearly 2.5 million children under the age of five years. The next polio immunization campaign in the country is scheduled for 24-26 February 2007.</span></p>
