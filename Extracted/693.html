<h1 class="headline">2002 - Leishmaniasis in Pakistan - Update</h1>
<p>
<span><b>12 February 2002</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>WHO and the Ministry of Health have carried out a second
assessment mission to the Northwest Frontier Province (<a href="/csr/don/2002_01_16/en">see previous report</a>) and have reported 5000 cases
of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Kurram Agency and other Agencies of the Province. The
epidemiological pattern suggests anthroponotic transmission (man to man) through the
sandfly vector with no animals involved.</span></p>
<p>
<span>15 000 vials of petavalent antimonials (first-line drugs)
are needed immediately to treat the cases. WHO has sent 7 000 vials to the WHO Country
Office and the government of Iran has generously pledged an additional 1 670 vials.
 WHO has purchased the remaining drugs still required (6 400 vials), which will be
available in early March.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The mission recommended a plan of action to involve the
Ministry of Health, WHO, UNHCR and nongovernmental organizations in the area which will
cover: the training of local health workers and the translation of guidelines into the
local languages, intensified surveillance and vector control activities to prevent
further transmission.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The most
affected group in Kurram Agency are children below the age of 15.</span></p>
