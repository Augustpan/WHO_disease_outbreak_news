<h1 class="headline"> Cholera in Liberia - Update 4</h1>
<p>
<span><b>25 August 2003 <br/><br/> Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 19 August, WHO has reported a total number of 3889 cholera cases since the beginning of 2003. Since the beginning of June, 2464 cholera cases have been registered. These figures do not include mild cases for which data is not currently available, and underestimates the number of cases for the months of June, July and August. To date, the number of deaths is unobtainable.</span></p>
<p>
<span>This epidemiological information is based on data provided by Médecins sans Frontières Belgium and France and MERLIN who have been working in Monrovia during the outbreak.</span></p>
<p>
<span>As <a href=" http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_08_18a/en/">reported previously,</a> it is likely that an increase in cases will occur in the coming weeks because of the movement of people, overcrowded living conditions in central Monrovia and the lack of safe water.</span></p>
