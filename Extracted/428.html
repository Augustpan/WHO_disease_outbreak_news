<h1 class="headline">2000 - Rift Valley fever in Yemen - Update</h1>
<p>
<span><b>03 October 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 2 October, 321 suspected cases of Rift Valley fever
(RVF) with 32 deaths have been reported in Yemen.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In Yemen, 8 teams of physicians and veterinarians are
conducting active surveillance in the outbreak area. The epicentre of the outbreak is in
Wadi Mawr, El-Zuhrah district in Hodeidah Governorate. The mean age of affected patients
is 36.5 years (range 2 months to 90 years).</span></p>
<p>
<span>Confirmed cases of disease have been detected in villages
throughout Wadi Mawr. Laboratory capability has been established to detect IgM and IgG
class antibody to RVF. Of 59 persons who met the suspect case definition, 29 (51%) had IgM
anti-RVF antibody.  Results of surveys in animals from the outbreak area and adjacent
Wadis will be available in the next few days.  Surveillance for disease in animals
has detected considerable morbidity and mortality in sheep, goats and cattle (most of
which has been reported in Wadi Mawr).</span></p>
<p>
<span>Surveillance in humans and animals is ongoing in these
sites to determine the extent of possible transmission.  Surveillance data in humans
and animals is being used to define high-risk areas which are being targeted for vector
control. Efforts are being made to build local capacity to respond to the outbreak,
including training on laboratory methods, vector control and surveillance.</span></p>
<p>
<span>This outbreak has occurred at the same time as the outbreak
of RVF in Saudi Arabia (<a href="/csr/don/2000_09_29/en">see previous report</a>).
WHO advises that persons can travel freely to and from both Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
Persons travelling within the affected districts should wear long-sleeved shirts and
trousers and should use mosquito repellent and bednets, and avoid contact with sick
livestock.</span></p>
