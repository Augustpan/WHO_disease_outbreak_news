<h1 class="headline">2000 - Yellow fever in Brazil</h1>
<p>
<span><b>14 January 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>On 13 January, the National Epidemiology Center (CENEPI), Brazil, reported 3
laboratory-confirmed cases of yellow fever to WHO. All 3 persons were infected while on
holiday in December in the National Park of Chapada dos Veadeiros, Alta Paraiso, Goias
State, located approximately 250 km north of Brasilia. The park is in a forested area
where yellow fever is known to be endemic, thus these cases resulted from sylvatic
transmission.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Two of the cases were in residents of Brasilia (one fatal case) and 1 case was in Rio
de Janeiro. Because the cases were recognized in non-endemic urban areas where <i>Aedes
aegypti</i> mosquitoes are present, immunization programmes and vector control measures
are being carried out in both cities to avoid any potential urban transmission. Adequate
supplies of yellow fever vaccine are available in Brazil.</span></p>
