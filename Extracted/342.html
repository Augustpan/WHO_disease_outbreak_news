<p>
<span><b>14 April 1999</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>An outbreak of meningococcal meningitis, which started in early January,
is affecting<i> </i>most of the country with the exception of three regions in the south.
  The regions with the highest number of cases are Oio (844 cases, 84 deaths), Bafata (349
  cases, 56 deaths) and Gabu (344 cases, 75 deaths). The causative organism has been
  identified as <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> serogroup A.</span></p>
<p>
<span>At the end of March a cumulative total of 1,307 cases and 158 deaths had been notified.
As of 5 April 2,169 cases and 404 deaths were reported. This increase is not only due to
  new cases but also to more complete reporting.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The national health authorities and international partners including local
representatives of the IFRC, MSF, UNICEF and WHO are implementing measures to control the
  outbreak, the most important of which is an ongoing vaccination campaign.</span></p>
<p>
<span>As the epidemic has extended to affect new areas, the target population for vaccination
has been increased. In response to increased need for vaccine French cooperation and MSF
  have each provided 250.000 doses of vaccines and WHO has supplied a further 100.000 doses.</span></p>
