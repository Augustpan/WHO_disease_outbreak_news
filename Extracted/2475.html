<span>Between 9 and 10 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 7 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 2 deaths. </span></p>
<h3 class="section_head1">Details of the cases</h3>
<ul class="decimal">
<li>A 75-year-old male from Taif city developed symptoms on 1 March and, on 7 March, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 9 March. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. The patient has a history of frequent contact with dromedaries and consumption of their raw milk. He has no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. </li>
<li>A 62-year-old male from Jubail city developed symptoms on 5 March and, on 7 March, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient has a history of frequent contact with dromedaries and consumption of their raw milk. He has no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. </li>
<li>A 26-year-old male from Buraidah city developed symptoms on 6 March and, on 7 March, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 9 March. Currently, he is in stable condition in home isolation. The patient is a healthcare worker in the hospital where the MERS-CoV outbreak is occurring. Investigation of epidemiological links with the MERS-CoV cases hospitalized in the same hospital is ongoing. The patient has no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. </li>
<li>A 22-year-old female from Buraidah city was admitted to the hospital where the MERS-CoV outbreak is occurring for an unrelated medical condition on 3 March and was discharged on the same day. On 4 March, she developed symptoms, on 6 March, she was admitted to the same hospital and, on 8 March, the patient tested positive for MERS-CoV. The patient, who has comorbidities, is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of epidemiological links with MERS-CoV cases hospitalized in the same hospital or with shared healthcare workers is ongoing. The patient has no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. </li>
<li>A 29-year-old male from Buraidah city developed symptoms on 6 March while being admitted to the hospital where the MERS-CoV outbreak is occurring – the patient was admitted to the hospital for an unrelated medical condition on 28 February. The patient, who had comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 8 March. He passed away on 9 March. Investigation of epidemiological links with MERS-CoV cases hospitalized in the same hospital or with shared healthcare workers is ongoing. The patient has no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. </li>
<li>A 64-year-old, non-national male from Jeddah city developed symptoms on 1 March and, on 7 March, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who had comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 8 March. He passed away on 8 March. Investigation of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. </li>
<li>A 50-year-old male from Buraidah city was admitted to the hospital where the MERS-CoV outbreak is occurring for an unrelated medical condition on 2 February. While hospitalized, he developed symptoms on 4 March.* The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 8 March. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU on mechanical ventilation. Investigation of epidemiological links with MERS-CoV cases hospitalized in the same hospital or with shared healthcare workers is ongoing. He has no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. </li>

<p>
<span>Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 1 MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 14 March (case no. 14).</span></p>
<p>
<span>Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,684 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 600 related deaths.</span></p>
<h3 class="section_head1">WHO risk assessment</h3>
<p>
<span>MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. </span></p>
<p>
<span>The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. </span></p>
<h3 class="section_head1">WHO advice</h3>
<p>
<span>Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.</span></p>
