<p>
<span><b>17 August 2000</b> <br/><br/><b>Disease Outbreak Reported</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>As of 17 August, a total of 855 cases and 19 deaths has
been reported in Addis Ababa since the beginning of the current outbreak of meningococcal
disease, which began in March 2000. <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> serogroups A (90%) and C
(10%) have been detected using latex agglutination tests in 311 of the patients.  The
age group most affected is &lt; 30 years.  According to available data, no major
outbreaks had been reported in Addis Ababa since 1989.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Ethiopia is in the African meningitis belt, and is
regularly affected by both the endemic and epidemic forms of the disease. Outbreaks have
been recorded since 1935. The most recent major outbreak affecting the whole country
occurred in 1988-1989, with nearly 50 000 cases and 990 deaths, and an overall attack
rate of 133 per 100 000. A major outbreak is anticipated in 1999-2000, and the
regions of Amhara, Gambella and Tigray experienced an increase in the number of cases
reported in March-April 2000.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Regional health authorities are conducting active
surveillance in public and private health facilities, and committees are ensuring
community surveillance. Cases are managed at hospital level by IV antibiotics (penicillin
and chloramphenicol). The Ministry of Health has some stocks of oily chloramphenicol, but
stock levels need to be carefully monitored.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Mass immunization in Addis Ababa is under way with 1 000
000 people vaccinated to date, and external support may be needed depending on the
evolution of outbreak.</span></p>
