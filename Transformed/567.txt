392 deaths in ten out of the eleven regions in the country (see previous report).  Although overall the
epidemic is now declining, new zones and districts are still being affected. 
Médecins sans Frontières, Belgium, France, Holland and Switzerland and the Ethiopian Red
Cross Society are assisting the Ethiopian Ministry of Health in implementing the 
vaccination campaigns. Campaigns has been concluded in those regions which had originally
exceeded the epidemic threshold and the focus is now on newly affected areas, particularly
3 districts: Dembia in Amhara region; Degem and Abote in Oromiya region.

Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control (ICG) has released a
further 370 000 doses of vaccine to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies to assist in the implementation of the vaccination campaigns in the
newly-affected areas.

In response to WHO's request to its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response
Network, a senior communicable disease epidemiologist in the Institut National de
Veille Sanitaire, Paris, France provided support to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health in
data analysis, strategy development and coordination of the response.  A second
epidemiologist from Swiss Disaster Relief, another partner in the Network, is continuing
to assist the Epidemiological Department of the Ethiopian Ministry of Health and
supporting the response in the Oromiya region.

Funds have been provided by the
governments of Ireland and Japan for the international response.
