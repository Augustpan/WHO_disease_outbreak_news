7 December 2005

Following the report of a yellow fever outbreak near the border with Burkina Faso (see previous report), a mass vaccination campaign was organized targeting the affected sub-district of Doropo in Bouna district. This campaign achieved a vaccination coverage of 100% and resulted in the immunization of 26 114 persons.

To limit the risk of transmission of the disease in this region, a vaccination campaign targeting a population of 290 000 persons in the remainder of Bouna district and the surrounding district of Bondoukou is planned in late December, with support from the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO).
