the next two days.

Collaborating Centre at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) United
States, Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) Italy and Médecins sans Frontières (MSF)

Disease distribution and reporting
Investigations to determine the distribution of EHF in cases in the region are
intensifying. On 18 October, WHO staff travelled to Kitgum to investigate reports that
cases were occurring in this city and found no evidence of current disease activity.
  Epidemiologists from WHO, CDC and Epicentre, France are supporting the Ministry of
Health in the investigation.  The case definition for the disease is being improved
so as to ensure accurate case finding and contact tracing.
