Meningococcal disease in Uganda

25 January 2006 

From 28 December 2005 to 23 January 2006, 163 suspected cases of meningococcal disease have been reported from the district of Nakapiripirit in north-eastern Uganda. Four cerebral spinal fluid specimens were positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A by latex test. Two of these were also confirmed by culture at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Uganda.

The Ministry of Health has constituted a National Task force, including Médecins sans Frontières, UNICEF and WHO to plan and coordinate the response. WHO is also supporting the Ministry of Health in their field investigations in affected and surrounding districts (Kitgum and Moroto) and in strengthening surveillance.
