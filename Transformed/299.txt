1999 - Cholera in Sierra Leone

14 September 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation has reported to WHO an outbreak of cholera, with
134 cases and 1 death between 1 and 6 September. Of 8 stool specimens sent for laboratory
tests, 6 were positive for Vibrio cholerae O1 subtype Ogawa. Tests have revealed
sensitivity to tetracycline, doxycycline and cotrimoxazole.

WHO and other partners have been supporting the Ministry in taking appropriate control
measures, e.g. reactivation of the cholera task force, establishment of specific
subcommittees (for surveillance, case management and sanitation) and of cholera treatment
centres. Mass health education campaigns are being carried out and communications networks
are being strengthened. Available supplies are adequate for the treatment of 3 000 cases.
