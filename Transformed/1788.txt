Spain* has reported two ongoing measles outbreaks since October 2010, with more than 600 cases reported in Andalusia.  In the first outbreak, the most affected areas are Sevilla and surrounding municipalities, where more than 350 measles cases have been reported since January 2011. Cases of measles are reported among healthcare workers as well. The second outbreak was reported in the province of Granada, where about 250 cases have been reported since October 2010.

In all the outbreaks except for the second outbreak in Spain and the outbreak in Turkey, the D4 genotype of measles virus has been confirmed.  The B3 genotype of measles virus was isolated from cases in the second measles outbreak in Spain, while the D9 genotype, originating from and common in south-east Asia (e.g. Malaysia and Indonesia) was confirmed to have caused the outbreak in Istanbul, Turkey in January 2011.



In addition, this year, there have been outbreaks and an increase in the number of cases reported in Germany*, the Netherlands*, Norway*, Romania*, Russian Federation**, Switzerland* and the United Kingdom*.

Travel increases the risk for exposure to measles virus and its further spread into susceptible populations if not vaccinated. To prevent further spread, WHO encourages health authorities to advocate for immunization before travel and to provide immunizations through health systemsâ€™ immunization services according to existing national immunization schedules. 

WHO recommends two doses of measles vaccine for all children and at least one dose prior to international travel for adolescents and adults who are unsure about their immunity status.
