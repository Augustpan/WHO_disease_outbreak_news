The outbreak is declining in the western part of the country except for Bousso where there are new outbreaks. The outbreak started in Massaguet (Hadjar Lamine) north of N'Djaména, the capital city, and from there it spread to Lac and Kanem provinces as well as to N'Djaména. Cases have now been reported in Mongo and Ati , two areas between N'Djamena and Abeché.

A team from the Global Task Force on Cholera Control composed of a public health specialist and 3 sanitation engineers will work with the Ministry of Health in assessing and supporting preparedness activities, which are being organized by international aid agencies and nongovernmental organizations in eastern Chad, in the areas where refugees from Darfur are present.
