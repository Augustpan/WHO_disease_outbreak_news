The epidemic threshold has been crossed in two neighbouring districts, Madarounfa and Guidan-Roumdji. Over 40 specimens of cerebral spinal fluid have been found positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A.

An immunization campaign has started in both districts, with the support from international agencies and nongovernmental organizations.
