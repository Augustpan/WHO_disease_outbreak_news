1998 - Cholera in Sri Lanka

25 November 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported

An increase in the number of cholera cases has been reported in the capital city
Colombo. Of the 60 new cases reported in the week 16-22 November, 40 were registered in
  Colombo district (including 32 in the city itself).  No deaths have been reported.

Public health inspectors have been mobilized to track down sources of infection in
Colombo city.  In addition, the Ministry of Health has already implemented many
  cholera control activities throughout the country.  However, cholera has spread to
  several districts previously free of the disease, where sanitation remains inadequate.

Sri Lanka is suffering from a cholera outbreak which started at the end of September
1997.  A total of 431 cases were reported for 1997.  As of 13 November 1998, the
  total number of cases notified for 1998 is 1 264, with 36 deaths. On average, 125 cases
  per month have been reported this year, with a case-fatality rate of 2.7 %.
